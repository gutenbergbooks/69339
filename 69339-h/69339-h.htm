<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>S</span>anta Barbara,</span> being the most leeward of the
Sugar States, is at the angle of the Continent, with
two coasts, one facing north, the other east. The
city of Santa Barbara is in a bay at the angle where these
two coasts trend from each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those who will look at the map of the State will see
that it contains, in all, ten provinces: three eastern,
four central, three western, each of which must be briefly
described. The visitor sees the land as low-lying coast,
growing sugar, with immense ranges of scrub, wild land
and pasture behind the sugar country, then foothills above
and behind the ranges, and behind the foothills, as the
southern boundary of the State, the Sierras of the Three
Kings, all forest to the snowline.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The easternmost province of the State is that of Santa
Barbara, which contains the capital city. This, Meruel and
Redemption, are the three eastern provinces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meruel, to the south of Santa Barbara, has a more temperate
climate than the western provinces, owing to the cold
Southern Drift which follows the prevalent southerly
along the coast. Meruel, the capital of the province,
stands on a rise of iron outcrop which gives the earth a
reddish look. The people of Santa Barbara nicknamed
the Meruel land “the Red Country” and the Meruel
people “the Reds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Redemption, the coal country, lies to the south and
west of Meruel. It was formerly a small independent
Republic. It was seized by Santa Barbara in 1865, in
the war of aggression known as the Redemption War,
when a young man, Lopez Zubiaga, the son of a Meruel
landowner, “wedded” (as they put it) “the Meruel iron
to the Redemption coal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The four central provinces are Pituba, near the sea,
San Jacinto, in the heart of the State, and the two mountain
masses, Gaspar and Melchior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pituba, once the home of the warlike Carib race, the
Pitubas, is now one of the richest sugar countries in the
world. It stretches along the northern coast for nearly
two hundred miles, no mile of which is without its plantation,
either of sugar or of coffee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>San Jacinto, which lies to the south of Pituba, is the
most barren of the provinces; most of it is of that poor
soil known as scrubs or burnt land: it is mainly thorny
waste, with patches of pasture. In spite of its barrenness,
it is most beautiful, because of its expanses. Its chief
town, the Mission city of San Jacinto, stands on a peninsula
rock above the river of San Jacinto, which rises in the
Sierras and comes down in force there, in a raddled and
dangerous stream (now controlled so as to be navigable).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaspar and Melchior, to the south of San Jacinto, are
vast, wild, forested mountain masses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three western provinces are Baltazar, Encinitas and
Matoche.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baltazar, to the south, is a mountain mass, forested to
the snowline: it is part of the Sierra, like Gaspar and
Melchior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Encinitas, to the north of Baltazar, lies between the San
Jacinto River and the Western Bay. Of all the provinces,
Encinitas is the most delightful to an English mind. It
is mainly an expanse of grass, marvellous to see. It rises
from the river into a range of downs or gentle hills, called
the Encarnacion Hills, which are crowned with a little
walled town, called Encinitas, because the Conquistador,
who founded it, came from the village of that name in Spain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the north of Encinitas there is a narrow, hilly strip
which thrusts out a snout into the ocean. The strip is
the western province of Matoche: the snout is the northernmost
point of the State, Cape Caliente. The copper found
in the hills is smelted and exported at Port Matoche, on
the western coast of the snout, in the deep water at the
mouth of the Western Bay, the State’s western boundary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bay is a deep, dangerous expanse dotted with
volcanic islets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the time of this story, and for many years afterwards,
only seven of the ten provinces ranked as inhabited. The
mass of the Sierras, forest to the snowline, were hardly
visited by white men: the three forest provinces of Gaspar,
Melchior and Baltazar had not been explored. Seasonal
rains made the forest unendurable from November until
April: the forest fever, to which the Indians burnt copal
in copper bowls, was fatal to man and beast from April till
November.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>At the time of the Spanish Conquest the lowlands were
inhabited by small warlike tribes of Caribs who lived in
stockaded settlements near the coasts. Of these tribes,
the Araguayas, of Meruel, and the Pitubas, of Pituba, were
the most important. When the Spaniards landed, Don
Manuel of Encinitas, the Conquistador of the State, allied
himself to the Pitubas by marrying the daughter of their
chief. With the help of his allies he exterminated the
Araguayas and drove the survivors of all other tribes into
the forests of the south, where a few of their descendants
still exist, as forest-Indians; that is, as the shadows of
what they were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the conquest, vast tracks of land in Encinitas were
granted to Don Manuel: other tracts in San Jacinto were
granted to a Castilian noble, from whom they passed to
a branch of the de Leyvas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The colony or province of Santa Barbara was administered
like all other Spanish possessions in the New
World for a little more than three centuries. Jesuit
missionaries converted the Indians; the owners of
haciendas imported negroes. In the course of the three
centuries the northward provinces became sparsely inhabited
by horse and cattle breeders, sugar-growers, rum-makers
and copper-miners, governed (if it can be called
government) by a Viceroy in Santa Barbara city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the year 1817, the inhabitants, following the example
of other Spanish colonists, broke the link with Spain, by
declaring the land to be the Republic of Santa Barbara,
with a Constitution partly modelled upon that of the
United States. At the time of the foundation of the
Republic the State contained, perhaps, one hundred
thousand souls, of whom not more than one-third were
white.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It happened that a retired English naval lieutenant
named William Higgs-Rixon took a prominent part in
the capture of Santa Barbara from the Spanish garrison.
For this reason, and from the fact that English merchants
were the only traders to and from the country, English
was taught in the schools, and English people were (as
they still are) popular throughout the State. After the
War of Independence a good many Englishmen came (and
were welcomed) as settlers in the land about Santa Barbara
city. In the ’fifties and ’sixties the copper boom brought
others, mostly Cornishmen, to Matoche. After the Redemption
War a good many more (mostly from the northern
Midlands) came to Meruel, to mine iron or coal. In the
’seventies others, from all parts of England, settled as sugar-planters
along the northern sea coast in the Pituba country.
These men, though they were but a sprinkling, helped
profound changes in the land, which in three generations
of men multiplied the population tenfold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is well, now, to talk of these changes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon after the establishment of the Republic the two
political parties in the land became defined as Feudalist
and Modernist. In Encinitas and in western San Jacinto,
the will of the great landowners was still law: in Santa
Barbara City, Pituba and in Meruel a new and vigorous
race was demanding freedom from the feudal lords and
wider teaching than the priests gave. As the feeling
between the two parties ran highest upon the point of
Church teaching, the Church party, which was that of the
great landlords, came to be known as the Surplices or
Whites. For a while, as the Reds were without a leader,
the governments of the Republic were White.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mention was made of one Lopez Zubiaga, who seized
the coal country of Redemption in 1865. This Lopez, born
in 1840, was the first leader of the Red or forward party
to count in affairs. At the time of the Redemption raid,
he was a tall, strongly built, masterful and very handsome
young man, with a contemptuous manner and savage
courage. He was fair-haired and blue-eyed, which made
some think that he was not the son of the landowner,
but of an Englishman, named variously Corbet, Corphitt
or Cardiff, about whom there had been talk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After his success in seizing Redemption, Lopez was
elected President of the Republic in place of old General
Chavez, the White. As President he rallied the Reds,
and carried through what was called “the Liberal
Struggle,” which made all Meruel and Redemption places
of mines and factories, and took the schools from the control
of the Church. After four years of his Presidency, the
Whites returned to office, under the hidalgo, Miguel de
Leyva, of San Jacinto, a man of burning faith, more ardent
than wise, who provoked the forward party almost to the
point of civil war. At the next election, the Whites were
turned out of office and the Reds put in, with such
unanimity that Lopez could rule as he chose. After the
election of 1878, which repeated his triumph, Lopez
declared himself Dictator, “while his country had need of
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miguel de Leyva, disgusted, retired from politics: the
Whites had no other leader, save young General Luis
Chavez, who was indolent, and Hermengildo Bazan, who
was only a speaker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Dictatorship of Lopez was marked outwardly by a
great increase in the foreign trade of the eastern provinces,
the threefold growth of the city of Santa Barbara, and an
improvement of all the ports, harbours and coastwise
railways. After 1884, those who studied the land’s
politics felt that the real Dictator was no longer Lopez, but
old Mordred Weycock, the manager of the United Sugar
Company, an unscrupulous business man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was at this time that the oddness and brusqueness in
Lopez’ character changed to a madness not likely to be
forgotten.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The madness began to show itself in a passion for building
big and costly public works. He rebuilt the cathedral (a
Colonial Renaissance building) on the lines of the temple at
Hloatl. He built himself a palace of glass, having heard,
though wrongly, that the Queen of England lived in one.
He then built himself a summerhouse, roofed with silver
plates, and added to it an ivory room inlaid with gold.
Being a Red, he caused all the bread used in his palace to
be coloured red. He frequented shambles in order to see,
as he said, “the divine colour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had two favourites. Livio and Zarzas; two negro
servants, Green Feather and the Knife; and one son, the
child of his youth, Don José, born in 1860, a depraved youth
of sickly beauty, who headed a clique of vicious lads at
the court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Late in the year 1886, the Dictator’s madness began to
take other forms, of hatred and suspicion of the Whites,
fear of assassination, and the belief that he was god. All
these obsessions were fostered by Mordred Weycock, who
contrived to win, from each of them, advantages for himself
or his firm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In all his schemes, Mordred was helped by his nephew,
Roger Weycock, twenty-seven years of age, who had been
in Santa Barbara since 1883, after having failed for the
Diplomatic Service. Roger was a tall, polite, brown-haired,
fair-bearded man, with a pleasant manner and a pale,
inscrutable face. He was the channel through which
Englishmen knew Santa Barbara. It was through his
able weekly letters to the English press that English opinion
was in favour of Lopez for so long. He knew Lopez to be
mad; but the Red party favoured his firm and he had no
pity for the Whites: old Miguel de Leyva had once kept
him waiting in the hall, and had then brushed by to lunch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miguel de Leyva was now dead, leaving many children,
including his youngest, the girl Carlotta, born in 1868, who
even in infancy impressed people as a creature from another
world. She comes into this story (as into many others)
as a rare thing, whose passing made all things not quite
the same. She was of a delicate, exquisite, unearthly
charm, which swayed men, women and children: the
Indians of San Jacinto used to kneel as she passed: some
have said that animals and birds would come to her: at
the least she had a beauty and grace not usual.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Nearly all the province of Encinitas was owned by the
last descendant of the Conquistador, Don Manuel of
Encinitas, who lived at his palace in his town, or in his
hacienda below it, with his old mother, whom they called
the Queen Dowager.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Don Manuel was born in 1857. He has been so often
described, that it need only be said of him that he was a
very glorious young man, noble in beauty and in intellect.
In the days of this story he was an unmarried man of not
quite thirty. In his youth, before his father died, he had
had his wild time in the city with other young men. He
had been a friend of Don José, Don Lopez’ son, and had
practised black magic with Rafael Hirsch. All this ceased
when his father died in 1879. Since then he had lived at
Encarnacion, breeding horses, for the men of his State, who
are among the great horsemen of the world. He took his
stature, beauty and masterful fierce eyes from his mother,
the Queen Dowager, who had been a Peralta from Matoche.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In October, 1886, Don Manuel met Carlotta de Leyva
for the first time: they became betrothed that same month,
to the great joy of the Queen Dowager, who had longed to
see her son married.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miguel de Leyva had a sister Emilia, who married a
Piranha of Santa Barbara city, and lived there, after her
husband’s death, in a house too big for her fortune. She
had been much in England with her husband, either for
pleasure or the marketing of copper. She spoke English
well. She caused her daughter Rosa, who had been for
some years a convent friend of her cousin Carlotta, to spend
a year in an English household. Rosa returned to Santa
Barbara from England some months before this tale begins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosa Piranha was then nearly twenty, being a few months
older than Carlotta. She was slight in build and not very
strong, but had a mannish spirit, with courage and dash
enough for anything. She had no looks: she was very
short-sighted: she always wore tinted spectacles, even
when indoors. Yet she was amusing, and very attractive:
several Englishmen proposed to her during her stay in
England; but she would not marry into their Church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was brown-haired, not dark like most of her country
women. In herself she had that mixture of boyish cheek
with feminine grace which one loves in Viola, in “Twelfth
Night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On New Year’s Day, 1887, Carlotta and Manuel planned
to be married at Easter, in the cathedral church of Santa
Barbara.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On that same New Year’s Day, Don Lopez, the Dictator,
in his palace of Plaza Verde, in Santa Barbara city, gave a
lunch to some of the great of the State, the Red ministers,
his son Don José, his creatures Don Livio and Don Zarzas,
some merchants and English speculators and the Archbishop
of Santa Barbara. At this lunch he publicly accused
the prelate of using the power of the Church against the
Red party. “I have my eyes everywhere, like the
Almighty,” he said. “Nor can there be two supreme
authorities, here or in heaven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To this the Archbishop replied: “There is but one
supreme authority: Lucifer has always found that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To this Don Lopez answered: “A greater than Lucifer
prepares his wings.” Having said this, in tones of threat,
he rose from the banquet, told Pluma Verde to call the
prelate’s carriage, and invited his other guests to come
within, to watch some dancers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roger Weycock, who was present at this lunch, has left
an account of it in his history, <span class='it'>The Last of the Dictators</span>,
where he says that, “It made him feel that some explosion
within the State was about to occur.” He wrote that
evening to the English newspapers that Don Lopez had
received information of a White conspiracy against him:
“No names were mentioned; but all the great White
families, as well as the Church, are said to be involved.
It is possible that Don Lopez will be forced to take extreme
measures, to end for ever the menace of White reprisals.
The Whites have never forgiven and never will forgive his
part in ‘the Liberal struggle’ and in the remaking of the
land. The Church hates him for his establishment of
secular schools: the great landowners hate him for his
establishment of a commercial class which out-manœuvres
them in Senate and out-votes them in Congress. This
must not seem to suggest that either Church or hidalgos
would go so far as to employ an assassin; but both parties
of the White side control large numbers of violent, ignorant,
passionate fanatics, to whom the killing of Lopez would be
an act pleasing to God. What Don Lopez seems to expect
is a <span class='it'>soulèvement générale</span> of the Whites against his government
at the time of the Easter celebrations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Undoubtedly, with such a ruler as Don Lopez, forewarned
is forearmed: we need not doubt that he has the
situation well in hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As it happens, another Englishman, without any bias of
party or interest, saw Don Lopez on this New Year’s Day,
and described him thus: “I watched Don Lopez, while I
was with him, very carefully, because of the strange tales
I had heard of his extravagance in building, in cedarwood,
ivory and silver, etc. I had thought that these were lies
or exaggerations, but I am now convinced that they are
true. He has built or begun to build such buildings, but
not finished them: he never finishes: he begins, then
begins something grander, and then begins something new.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the time that I was with him some unseen musicians
made music upon some Indian instruments, seemingly of
some kind of strings and a rattle. It was irritating at
first, then perplexing, then troublesome and exciting. I
was told that he has this music always in his palace. He
listened to what I had to say with attention, and said that
what I wished should be done. Then, to my surprise, he
said, ‘They are seeking my life. One of them was behind
the gateway this afternoon. See there, you see that man
passing beyond the gates? He is a murderer, paid by
those Whites to kill me. My mission here is not accomplished.
It is but begun. What did Jove do in heaven?
He forged thunderbolts. He crushed them. But Jove
was all-seeing. I, too, am becoming all-seeing. This
palace may seem stone to your eyes, but it is not stone.
It is all eyes, and this city is all eyes, and I see into their
hearts, into their councils, into the pretence of their God.
But a little while longer and the world will see that a
ruler can be godlike, as in Rome.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was made a little uneasy by his words and by the
restless, queer manner in which he uttered them. I had
seen him some years before, when I had been much struck
by his air of overbearing masterfulness. That air was still
on him. He looked masterful and overbearing, but there
was something about him now which did not look well.
His hair seemed thin and somewhat staring, his skin
seemed dry and his eyes both dry and bright. Then his
mouth, which had always shown an expression between
a snarl and a sneer, seemed permanently caught up at one
side, so as to show the teeth. Possibly it was some malformation,
possibly some play of muscle, which had become
habitual or fixed, but it gave the effect of a state of nerves,
never (as I should imagine) quite human, that had become
those of a tiger about to bite. I was suddenly reminded
of one of the late busts of Nero.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seeing me looking through the window at the marble
tank surrounding the palace fountain, he said to me,
‘What colour is the water in the fountain?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘It looks whiteish.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘So has my mercy to the Whites been,’ he said. ‘But
let them beware or I will fill that fountain with their blood
and their daughters shall come to see it play. If they call
too much upon God to help them, God shall reveal Himself.
If you have any White friend, tell him that. I am as
patient as God. But tell them that.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the time that he spoke his two great negroes stood
behind his throne, each holding his sword. They were
naked to the waist. People mistook them sometimes for
bronzes. That disgusting creature, his son, Don José,
stood at another window, killing flies. He was a languid-looking
youth, sickly and vicious, with a face of exquisite
features, showing neither intellect nor will, nothing but
depravity. He turned to me as his father ceased
speaking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘There will be a baptism of blood,’ he said, ‘to the
sound of flutes.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was time at that moment for the Dictator to ride
abroad. His Indians entered with his riding costume, a
golden head-dress and a tunic of gold chain-mail all set
about with the plumes of the scarlet-crested dill-birds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘See,’ he said, ‘this is what they force me to wear. I,
who am God, the father of this land, have to wear gold mail,
lest I be assassinated. Let them see to it.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When he had put this on, he looked, as he always did,
magnificent beyond description. I understood how it was
that his Indians worshipped him as God. They decked
him with a scarlet serape and led him out to his horse.
It was a white stallion, which he was afterwards said to
have fed with human flesh. He and his bodyguard of
Indians set out at a gallop. They always galloped at this
time from this fear of assassination, which had become an
obsession to him. I must say that I was glad when he had
gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One of his two negroes, the one with the knife, said,
‘He ride the White horse; that show the Whites he ride
them. He ride with spur, too: you see.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bill Ridden was an English gentleman who comes a little
into this story. In his youth he spent some years in Santa
Barbara, where he made a good deal of money in the
copper boom at Matoche. He was a very good friend to
the Piranhas at this time (and later in the copper crisis).
He was a man of strong affections; he kept in touch with
his friends in Santa Barbara long after he had returned to
England and settled down. He married in 1857. His
wife was Sarah Ocle, a loud, fresh-coloured, robust mare of
a woman, by whom, as he put it, he “sired some colts and
fillies, as well as a darned pup I might have drowned.”
This “pup” was his youngest son, Highworth Foliat
Ridden, born in 1869, who was not quite eighteen when
this tale begins. It was at Bill Ridden’s house that Rosa
Piranha spent her year in England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This house was the Foliats, in Berkshire, where Bill’s
mother’s people, the Foliats, had lived. It was a small,
red-brick Queen Anne house, with a racing stable at the
back and the Downs behind the racing stable. Here Bill
bred steeplechasers and rode much to hounds. Bill was
an ugly devil, foul-mouthed and rude, something between
a publican and a horse-coper in appearance, yet strangely
gentle with women and horses. He had a Judge Jeffreys
manner on the bench of magistrates. He loved his
daughter Bell and hated his youngest son. “If he had
been a pup,” he used to say, “I could have drowned him;
if he had been a trout, I could have put him back; but
being this, by God, there is nothing that I can do, short of
pitching him in at the deep end, to see if he’s got guts
enough not to sink.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His wife, Sarah Ridden, was fond of this son, but wished
that he would be like others boys, “not always messing
about with cog-wheels.” Her children had gone from her
into the world, with the exception of her daughter Bell, a
year older than the boy. She found life easier with the
boy out of the house, “not putting my old man’s back up.”
Quiet life, the Liverpool Spring Meeting and asparagus
were the things she loved best; but she was a fine rider
and understood horses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bell Ridden, the daughter, was a lovely, shy girl,
worshipped by her father and mother. As she lived at
home, she helped her father in the stable: she was clever
with horses; the stable boys loved her: she got more
out of them than Bill could. It was her instinct that
sent the Lilybud to Mandarin, by which Bill got Chinese
White, the horse which won him his glory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The five older children were scattered: Polly and Sally
married, Harold in a line regiment, Chilcote and Rowton in
the city, in copper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This brings us to the youngest son, Highworth Foliat
Ridden, the Hi of these pages, the lad who had not yet found
what he could do. He was of the middling height and build,
with brown hair, and a pleasant, freckled face, somewhat
puckered at the eyes from his habit of not wearing a hat.
His eyes were grey-blue, under eyebrows darker than one
would expect from the eyes: his nose was a small pug nose,
neatly made and set. His ears were well made and placed.
His mouth was wide, pleasant, thin-lipped and firm. He
was a nice-looking lad, who would have done well enough
under other parents, or with none.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Being the last of the seven, he came at a time when both
his parents had had enough of children, but wanted, as they
said, “a filly to finish up with.” As Hi turned out to be
a colt, or as Bill put it, “another of these buck pups to
have about,” he was a disappointment to them from the
first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went to the school where the other Riddens had been,
he got his second eleven colours in his last summer term;
but learned nothing; he was “always messing about with
cog-wheels.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Christmas holidays Bill called him into his
“study,” where he kept two hunting horns, six long hunting-pictures
by Henry Alken, seven foxes’ masks (one of them
almost white, killed in the winter of the great frost), eleven
crops on a rack, three small oil portraits of Moonbird,
Sirocco and Peter, much tobacco of all sorts, and many
bottles of liqueur, made by himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Highworth,” he said, “you’ve come to an age
now when you’ve got to decide what to do. You’ve had
a first-rate education; at least, if you haven’t, it’s your
own fault, I know it’s cost enough. Now what are you
going to be? What do you want to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, sir, as you know, I’ve always wanted to be an
engineer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve already gone into that, boy. I thought you knew
my mind on that point once for all. But it’s the kind of
answer I expected from this last report of yours. You
waste your time at an expensive public school messing with
toy engines with that young maniac you persuaded us to
invite here, and then say you want to be an engineer. A
nice thing it would be for your mother and sister to see you
a .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. mechanic doing the drains with a spanner. By
God, boy, you’ve got a fine sense of pride, I don’t
think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi said that engineering was a fine profession and that
lots of people went in for it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you know about its being a fine profession?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because it gives men all sorts of power, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Power be damned, boy. Power to stink of paraffin
whenever they go out to dinner; though that must be
seldom, even now, I’m glad to think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir James Russel was a fine man, sir; and so was
William Horrocks, who made the Gartishan Dam.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir James Russel may have been God Almighty, for
all I know or care; I never heard of him; but William
Horrocks I do know, or at least know of, for his uncle was
old John Horrocks, the mealman down at Kill Hill, and
a dirtier, old, snuffy scoundrel I never saw out of an
almshouse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know what his uncle was, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, boy, but if you will let me say so, the point is, that
I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir, but I am talking of William Horrocks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I understand as much. I am merely pointing
out to you, in the teeth of a great deal of interruption, that
your hero was a man whom no one here would touch with a
barge-pole or have inside his house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir, a man ought not to be judged by what his uncle is,
but by what he is in himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A man is judged by what his uncle is. In this country,
thank God, having respectable relations counts for a good
deal, and so it should. You’re a Ridden and a Foliat, and
I’m not going to have you messing an honoured name with
wheel-grease because you’ve read some damned subversive
rag which you’ve neither the sense to drop nor the wit to
judge. There are some things which a man can do and
keep his self-respect and be asked out to dinner, but going
round with a spanner isn’t one of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t ask to go round with a spanner, sir, nor to be
asked out to dinner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you ask, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would like to learn engineering, sir, because I’ve
always enjoyed engines and the application of power, and
that sort of thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you call that but going round with a spanner?
And how do you propose to learn engineering?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hoped, sir, that you would let me go to an engineering
works.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Engineering works be damned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see it, sir. It’s the thing I should do best.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I do see it, sir, and it’s the thing I won’t
have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why not, sir? I should work at it. I shouldn’t
disgrace you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your notions of disgrace aren’t mine. Your notions
of disgrace are the sort of damned sentiment that will
wreck this country and all that’s in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see why, sir. I don’t want to argue with you,
sir; but it is important to me: what I am to do all my
life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is equally important to me that my son should not
make a mistaken choice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what a man most wants to do, sir, can’t be a
mistaken choice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not a man; but a damned young ass. That
being so, and it is so, it’s for me to decide. I’ve got to
supply the money whatever you do; I suppose you won’t
deny that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was wondering, sir, whether you would advance to
me Aunt Melloney’s money, that I’m to have when I’m of
age, and let me pay for myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pay what for yourself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fees or premiums, sir, for going through the shops.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So that’s what the fellow meant, was it? Now I know.
‘The shops,’ he said. There was a drunken engineer at
Newmarket, who said, ‘Let the gentleman keep clear of
the shops.’ He was drunk when he said it; but that’s what
he meant; now I know; and he showed a fine sense of
the situation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you advance me the money, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll do nothing of the sort. These engineers and
fellows are a gang I will not tolerate. They defile God’s
country. They’ve already spoiled the hunting, and the
racing’s following as fast as it can go. If you’d been a boy
with any guts, instead of clockwork, you’d have been
glad, I should have thought, to have been at home here, and
borne a hand in the stable. Breeding is about the last
thing this poor country’s got in these damned days. We’ve
still got horses, thank God. We don’t depend on a traction-engine
gang, doing a tenth of the work for double the
money. Why don’t you take off your coat and come into
the stable? It’s a needed job; a pleasant job; and a
gentleman’s job, what’s more. What’s wrong with that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing, sir; but I’m not very good at horses. Besides,
you’ve got Bell in the stables. I should only be in the
way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ashamed of working with your sister, are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir; but Bell wouldn’t want me there, and you’d
always be swearing at me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damme,” Bill said, “there are things in you boys that
would make any father swear. You go to a prep. school for
three years, then to a public school for five years, then
you ask to be kept for another seven while you learn a
profession, and by God, when you’ve learnt it, you can’t
make a living at it. I’ve been talking to your mother about
this, as well as to Rosa Piranha before she sailed. You’ll
not go back to school, that I’m resolved on, after this last
report. You’ll stay here a week or two to get some clothes,
and then you’ll do what I did. You’ll go to Santa Barbara
and see if you can keep your head above water by your
own hands. If you can, well and good. You will have
letters to people; a lot better people than I ever had; and
you will have time given you to look about you. You
ought to be able to make good; I don’t say in copper, that
is over, but in a new land there are new things and new
opportunities. There are always sugar, tobacco and
ranching; there should be timber, cocoa, piacaba, countless
things. As I said, you ought to be able to make good.
If you can’t, it will be your own lookout. You’ve got to
paddle your own canoe, like any other youngest son. Now
I’m not going to have any argument about the superior
beauties of cog-wheels. I’ve written to people and written
about your ticket. Since you won’t work in the stable here
and have no choice of your own, except a damned dirty
falallery which I won’t have, you’ll go to Santa Barbara.
You may count yourself more than lucky to have the
chance. Very few youngest sons ever get into the sun at
all, but stink in a rotten town, by God, where even the
horses puke at the air they breathe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You turn up your nose, do you? I wish I was going
to Santa Barbara to have my time again. You can turn up
your nose as much as you like, but that’s what you’ll do,
so make up your mind to it. When you’ve seen the place
you’ll thank me for having sent you there. When you’ve
been there a few days you’ll thank your stars for your luck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi did not answer his father, knowing that thumbs were
down. His heart sank at the thought of the foreign
country, yet leaped again at the thought of liberty from
school and life beginning. He had still one little ray of
hope, which his mother extinguished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your father’s got his back up,” she said. “Between
you and me, Hi, he has had a bad year. Newmarket was
nearly a finisher. So be a good old sport and go; there’s
a dear. There’s far more scope there than here; everybody
says so. Besides, your Aunt Melloney’s money went into
Hicks’s. I don’t know that you could get it out, even if
your father agreed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a brief delay, in spite of Bill’s speed, because
the first letter from Rosa Piranha brought the news that
Santa Barbara politics were somewhat unsettled. Bill had
to pause to make some enquiries, through his sons in the
copper business and his friends in the United Sugar Company.
“It’s probably nothing much,” he said, when he
had heard the reports. “These Reds and Whites are
always at each other, in the way these foreigners always
are. It won’t concern the boy, if he’s got the sense to keep
out of it. Let him go and learn sense in the only school
for it.” After this, there was a second brief delay for farewell
visits to relations. When Hi returned from these, his
clothes, of drill and flannel, were ready in their ant-proof
tin trunks. Towards the end of February, he sailed for
Santa Barbara city in the <span class='it'>Recalde</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the week in which he left home, Don José, the
son of the Dictator, caused his favourite, Lucas Zanja, to
be beheaded in the ivory room, “so that he might enjoy,”
as he said, “the beauty of the blood upon the ivory.” Don

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>H</span>i</span> had planned to learn “enough Spanish to rub
along with” on the voyage out, but fate disposed
of this plan. He was seasick till after Lisbon;
then they started cricket; then, by chance, he met the third
engineer, who was as fond of cog-wheels as himself. After
this, he passed most of his time either in the third engineer’s
cabin or in the engine-room. He learned no Spanish whatever.
“You’ll not need it,” the third engineer said,
“they’re very intelligent people: they’ll make out what
you want.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ten mornings later Hi was roused from sleep by his cabin
steward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The dawn is just breaking, Mr. Ridden,” he said.
“We are just entering the outer harbour now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi turned out on deck in his pyjamas; he saw before him
the promised land of Santa Barbara about which he had
thought so much. It was still dim, close in shore. A big
light was near at hand to his right; a small revolving light
blinked far away to the left. In between, in the arc of the
bay, were the lights of the city and of the ships at anchor.
The city itself was little more than a smudge against a
darkness. Far beyond the city, in a line like an army, were
the high Sierras of the Three Kings. Their peaks rose up
out of the clouds like mountains in another world. As they
were now catching the dawn they seemed made of jewels.
Mount Gaspar was golden. Mount Baltazar was like a
bubble of blood, and Mount Melchior a blue and evil finger
glistening. As Hi watched, amazed by the beauty of the
scene, colour began to come upon the bay. He saw away
to his left an enormous expanse of shallow water, over
which strange birds, such as he had never seen, were now
passing from their night ashore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see those birds?” said the fourth officer of the
<span class='it'>Recalde</span> beside him. “They’re bobacherry birds. You
always see them working their lower jaws as though to get
the cherry in. It’s a pretty place, Santa Barb, of a morning
like this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He passed away to get the watch to the washing of the
decks; Hi remained staring at the shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had never thought that it was to be like this,” he
thought. “It’s like an earthly paradise. I might have
been stewing in London like Rowton; or being frozen up
six months of the year in British Columbia. I shall be as
happy here as the day is long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the <span class='it'>Recalde</span> passed the dead-slow limit Hi saw some
lighters bearing down upon her from both sides, urged by
the sweeps of such men as he had never seen nor dreamed
of. They were wild-looking men of enormous stature. All
were almost naked; all shone as though the life in them
made them radiant. All were of a rich red-golden colour
like new pennies. Even the smallest of them looked a
match for two strong Europeans. Even the most benign
of them looked like the devil he was and the cannibal he
could be. All wore gold, ivory or copper placques, shaped
like new moons, which hung from their noses and covered
their mouths. They looked curiously like the lids of letter-boxes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See those fellows, Mr. Ridden?” said the captain on
the bridge. “They’re Pitubas from up-country and they’re
cannibals to a man. You’d better put a coat over those
pyjamas of yours, or the sight of you may be more than
they can stand. They like their meat white, and they like
it young.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some of the lighters swept alongside and made fast, the
winches at once began at all three hatches; baggage and
mails were hove out before the <span class='it'>Recalde</span> reached her moorings.
At breakfast the tables were covered with flowers
and fruits, of kinds new to Hi. Clinging to the flowers were
insects, coloured like jewels, shaped like sticks, or leaves
or blades of grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is your first taste of the new world, Mr. Ridden,”
said the captain, “what d’you think of it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it’s amazing, sir,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s all that,” said the captain, “but after a few
years of it, you’ll curse these blue skies and give a year’s
pay to be able to see your breath.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think I shall ever tire of this, sir,” Hi said.
“It’s the kind of place I have dreamed of all my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pretty scenery,” the captain said. “But give me
Sefton Park.”</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>After breakfast, Hi was rowed ashore from the <span class='it'>Recalde</span>, to
begin his new life. He saw the <span class='it'>Recalde</span>, which linked him
with home (for his mother had walked her deck and leaned
over her rail), now drop away into the past. In front of
him was a new world, to which he had at present three
keys, his friendship with the Piranhas, a letter to Mr. Roger
Weycock of the Sugar Company, and a letter to Mr. Allan
Winter, a sugar-planter (not far from the city) whom Bill
had known in the past. These were his keys, but his father
had told him not to trust to them. “The thing you’ve
got to trust to, and the only thing, is just you yourself.
That’s the only key that will open doors to a man, of any
kind worth getting open.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With some distrust of this key and some anxiety about
his boatman’s fare, he drew near to the landing stairs,
where pirates of five colours, in turbans and kerchiefs of
every colour, showed their teeth at him and offered him all
things, from brothels to the new cathedral. As the boat
sidled up to the steps, he heard his name shouted: “Mr.
Highworth. Mr. Ridden. Mr. Highworth.” He caught
sight of a little man diving down the stairs at him and
crying, “Dammy, dammy, dammy, I’ll get drunk to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, Mr. Highworth, Mr. Highworth, Mr. Ridden,”
he cried. “Don’t ’ee know me? I knew you, sir; the
minute I seen ’ee.” Here he turned on the other pirates
who were laying hold of Hi’s baggage. “Get out of this,”
he said, in the seaport language made up of the oaths of
all civilised lands. “Get out of this, heekoes de pooters.
I take all the Señor’s gear. Don’t ’ee know me, Mr. Highworth?
I know thee, soon’s I seen ’ee.” He was weeping
like a child and sucking his tears into his mouth with
twitches of his face: he had all Hi’s baggage in his hands.
“Pay the boatman, sir,” he said. “One of the big ones
and a small one. This sort is sharks. You’d ought to
have took a licensed boat, which would have been only one
peseta.” He led the way up the stairs and shoved through
the crowd on the Mole. “O, dammy, dammy,” he kept
saying, “I’ll break into my burial money, but I’ll get
drunk to-night.” He was dressed in an old pair of English
riding breeches, a black velvet coat, much too tight at the
shoulders and elbows, a tall black sombrero, and part of a
yellow serape. Hi didn’t like the look of the man, nor his
display of emotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look at me, Master Highworth,” he said. “Don’t
’ee know me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t,” Hi said. “Who are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t ’ee know ’Zekiel Rust?” the man said. “I
did use to beat for Squire William Ridden, many’s the time,
till I had to run for it. I knowed you and your father and
Mr. Rowton and Miss Mary. But you were young, Mr.
Highworth. You might never have heard tell. They
may have kept it from you, the deed of gore I done. I’m
not an ordinary man, you understand. I had to run for
it; I’m Rust, the murderer. It was I killed old Keeper
Jackson. I’d a-been hung, if they’d a-took me. Now you
remember me? You remember how I killed Keeper
Jackson?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good Lord,” Hi said. “Yes; now I remember. And
you have been here ever since.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dammy, dammy, bless you for remembering,” the
man said. “Now, but Master Highworth, I don’t want to
presume; but I’ve been all these years, seven years now,
in this unchristian land, and I never see a word of anyone
come from the old part. Anyhow I’ll see to thy baggage,
Master Ridden. Now you want to go to a good hotel. The
Santiago is the one for you. I’ll see you to there, Master
Highworth, and I’ll look after you, and don’t you turn
from me, Master Highworth, for anyone would have killed
Keeper Jackson, the way he spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was out on a moony night, and I’ll tell ’ee just where
I were. I were up there by the valley, where the water
comes out; and it wasn’t murder really. I’d gone out
with my old pin-fire. It was a lovely moony night, and
I got a hare. Well then, a hare’s a rebel, ain’t he, and
game? So I got a hare and put ’un in my pocket and I
was going on away along up, when I see another hare.
He was on a bank just above the road. So ‘I’ll have ’ee,
my master,’ I says, and I up after him and I give him my
pin-fire and he went over the bank, and I went over the
bank; and he wasn’t a hare, not really, he was a fox. I
see him when I got up the bank. And there was Keeper
Jackson and he says, ‘I’ve got you, my man,’ he says,
‘you best come quiet.’ And I says, ‘That wasn’t a hare,’
I says, ‘that was a fox, and a fox is a rebel and he isn’t
game.’ And he says, ‘You come quiet. I’ve had my eye
on you a long time,’ he says, and he lets fly at me with his
gun. And one of the pellets went through my gaiters,
and so I give him pin-fire. And when I see I killed him, I
go along up the downs and there I come upon a man driving
sheep. I put old pin-fire in a ditch and cover him over.
I goes along with the man driving the sheep, until we come
to Salisbury. But I’ll tell you all about that. We’ll go
along to the Santiago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi remembered the man very well now as a poacher,
who did odd jobs for Squire Bill in the dog-breaking and
ferret business. It was perfectly true that he had murdered
Keeper Jackson and had been searched and advertised for
as a murderer, but had escaped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi had been only ten at the time; but the thing had
made a stir in that quiet place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time Ezekiel had hailed a carriage, partly by
signs and partly by noises, which the signs explained. For
a moment he showed Hi plainly that he meant to run after
the carriage until it reached the hotel, but this Hi would not
allow. He made him sit with him inside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re the first ever I’ve seen from anywhere near those
parts, Mr. Highworth,” Ezekiel said. “You see, after I
got to Salisbury, they read in a paper how the body was
found and it was me, so I thought I’d best not stay there,
so I out of the pub, and, as I come out of the pub, there come
up thirteen policemen and they were looking for me. And
they walked straight by me and never took me. So I
thought the best thing I could do is to follow these men
now they’ve passed me, so I followed them along a bit, and
then they separated, and I thought, ‘This won’t do,’ so
I went along the road a bit and there was a man driving
some cows, so I said to him, ‘I’m going along the road a
bit. Shall I help thee drive?’ So I drive them along a
bit, and he said to me, ‘Where are you going?’ And I
thought, ‘Well, it won’t do to tell anybody where I’m
going,’ so I said, ‘I’ll just turn back and go into the town
now.’ And so I turned back, because I thought, ‘Well,
he’ll notice me,’ and he must have been suspicious or he
wouldn’t have asked where I was going to. And I thought,
‘Now, I’ll diddle him like I diddled the policemen. I’ll go
right across this town and out the other side. No one
would think of looking for me there.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I went across and, as I was going across, I passed
like an inn yard, and just at that inn yard door, like a gateway,
there was Black George Rylands that used to drive
Mr. Hanshaw. If I’d a-took another step I’d a-been
right into him, and so I thought, ‘Now, Ezekiel Rust,
you’re doomed. They all knows that you’re here. They’re
all on the scent.’ So then I don’t know what to do, and
presently I see Black George turn away into the inn, so
then I made one dart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So then I got out of Salisbury, and I come up out on a
place, like it was downs, and there were some gipsy fellows
there. I’d known some of them come round with baskets,
but they didn’t know me, and I asked them which way I’d
better go to get out of England, and they said they’d set
me on the road, part of the way, and so we set off next
day and we come to a town. I thought I was safe when I
was with them, but, coming through that town, my blood
run cold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” said Hi. “Were there more police?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Mr. Ridden, there was not more police, there was
soldiers—soldiers after me, hundreds of ’em. I come into the
town, and there was all they soldiers in red coats, looking
for me. But I got past ’em and I come to a town, and there
was a man wanting another man to help him take charge
of a bull. He was coming out to these parts and there
was to have been another man in charge of the bull, but
the other man, if you understand me, Mr. Ridden, he didn’t
want, when the time come, to live up to his bargain. And
I didn’t want to let it be known, not at once, that I was
eager to get out of the country, because that wouldn’t have
done. They’d all have known that I was a murderer, if
I let ’em think that. Naturally that was the first thing
they’d have thought. So I pretended first I was afraid of
bulls, and then I said I didn’t like to leave my old mother,
and then I said I didn’t much like these foreign parts by
what I’d heard of them. I let them think the wrong thing,
you see, Mr. Highworth. But in the end I said I’d help
take the bull. So then they said they didn’t want to run
any risks, and said, ‘You’d better come on board straightaway.’
So they took me along and we passed through a
gate where there was a lot of notices and there I read what
made my blood run cold. Now I had always been against
they photographs. Often people said to me, ‘Now you
stand there and let me take your picture.’ But I knew
better. ‘No,’ I always used to say. My golly, Mr. Highworth,
I tell ’ee, there they’d got me all described and wrote
out. ‘Wanted, for murder, suffering from a crushed left
thumbnail,’ it said. It must have been Mrs. Thompson
told them that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may talk what you like, Mr. Ridden, about there
not being a God, but there is a God. And how do I know
that there is a God? Because, when I read that, there was
a policeman there and I got my left thumb in my pocket
at the moment, and, if I’d not had my left thumb in my
pocket at that moment, why, he’d have seen it, wouldn’t
he?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, that shows you whether there’s a God or not.
So the other fellows that wanted me to take the bull, they
didn’t want me to be reading there; they wanted me to
come along. But it wouldn’t have done to come along, not
with that policeman there. No, because he’d have thought
at once, ‘There’s something funny,’ if I’d have gone along.
There was fifty pounds reward, too, for me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the policeman says to one of the chaps that was
with me, ‘Seen anything of this chap?’ he says.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘No,’ they says, ‘worse luck, because we could do with
fifty pounds.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Well,’ he says, ‘he’s pretty sure to be coming around
here. Who’s this you’ve got?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Why,’ they says, ‘he’s a drover coming to look after
the old Astounder, that big bull they’ve got on board.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Well, I wish him joy of his job, then,’ the policeman
said, ‘for a bull is a fair coughdrop, when he’s seasick.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well then, we got on board the ship. That’ll show you
whether there’s a God or not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I hope your troubles were at an end then,” said
Hi.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Mr. Highworth, they were not. And why were they
not? Why, use is second nature, as we say. Soon as I
got on board that old ship, they said the captain wanted to
see me and so I thought, ‘Well, now they’ve caught me;
now what am I to do?’ Then I thought I’d better go,
I might brazen it out. And I went up to a place all shining,
and there was all the chief detectives of London town come
to look for me. And the captain, he says, ‘Now, my
man, what’s your name?’ Now what would you have
answered? Use is second nature, isn’t it? So I plumped
out straightaway ‘Ezekiel Rust,’ I said. Then, directly
I said that, I see what I done. And he said, ‘Well, you
put your name on that paper there.’ And then I know
what to do. I said, ‘Please, sir, I can’t write.’ And so
he says, ‘Well, you must put your mark.’ And there was
a man writing on a paper and he wrote my name, only
he hadn’t wrote it right. He wrote it wrong, because he
hadn’t followed what I said. He put ‘Jack Crust.’ And
so I put my mark and the detectives they looked at me and
they didn’t recognise me and I thought, ‘My boys, there’s
the worth of fifty pounds in me and I never been worth
more than eleven and a penny at one time before, and that
they cheated me of, coming back from the races.’ And so
he said, ‘Now, my man, go down to that bull and mind
he don’t toss you. They call him the Wrekin’s Astounder,’
he said, ‘and he’ll astound you, if you don’t be careful.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I went down and had a look at the bull and I
thought ‘This ’ere creature will be a friend to me. They
won’t come looking for me, not down with this old
Astounder.’ But they did come looking for me, and a
policeman come and they come with the captain and he
says, ‘Who’ve we got here,’ he says.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Oh, that’s the prize bull and his keeper,’ they says,
‘what you read about in the papers.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Well,’ I thought, ‘now I’m safe. There won’t be any
more policemen come along for me.’ Then the steward
come down. He calls me, ‘Crust, Crust. Where’s this
man, Crust?’ he says. It make my blood run cold to hear
my name called like that. So he says, ‘Come along and
get your tea, man. Get your tea while you can eat it.
We shall be gone in another hour and you’d best have
something to be sick on, if you’re going to be sick.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I sat down to supper with a lot of others, and be
darned if one of them didn’t say, ‘Your name Crust? You
any relation of the murderer?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘No,’ I said, ‘thank God.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And another said, ‘What murderer’s that, Bert?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Why,’ he says, ‘a man called Crust shot a gamekeeper
and there’s fifty pounds reward for him.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So then I saw that they suspected me and I said,
‘There’s only one way to deal with murderers and it’s
what they call the old way. They used to get a
great big tin of paraffin and they put the murderer into
that and then they boil him. Wherever that’s been tried,’
I said, ‘people know enough not to do any more, because
they know what they’ll get.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then one of them said, ‘Yes, but they’re not always
caught. They know that.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I said, ‘No, they’re not always caught at once,
but in the end they’re always caught.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you’d think that I’d run dare-devil escapes
enough by that time. That very evening the ship began
to go and I thought, ‘Now I’m free.’ And then I wake
up in the night and the ship were groaning awful. She gave
great creaking groans like right down and I thought, ‘I
know how it’s going to be. There’s going to be a storm,
because it knows that I’m on board and there’ll be a storm
until they find out who it is.’ And then some men came
by with a lantern and I was in the stall, if you understand
me, next to my bull, and I lay down in the straw and they
went past. They didn’t see me. And the next morning,
when I got up, I thought, ‘I’ll see whether we’re away
from England or not.’ So I went up, and the first thing
I see you could have knocked me down. There was a
lot of men-of-war’s men. Some of them was here and
some of them was there, if you understand what I mean.
They made my blood run cold. ‘I see what it is,’ I said,
‘They know I’ve come this way, but they don’t know which
I am and so they’re stopping and watching every place.
My only chance is to keep down just by the bull.’ So
I went down to him and he knew I had shot old Jackson,
and he rammed at me with his great horns and I stayed
there all day. I stayed down there two weeks. Proper
lot of whiskers I grew while I was down there. At the
end of that time the captain said, ‘I’ve never had a man,’
he said, ‘look after a beast like you’ve looked after that
old bull. Now I’ll give you five pounds,’ he said, those were
his words, ‘I’ll give you five pounds,’ that’ll show you
what he thought of me, ‘if you’ll stay and take the other
bulls that we have, like you took this. He eats out of your
hand just like a tame canary.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I said, ‘No, thank you, sir, I’m sure. I’d like to
go with my bull.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you’d think my troubles were at an end then. We
come to the foreign place where the bull was to go ashore.
It wasn’t here, it was somewhere further down from here.
I heard one of the men say, ‘The police-boat’s come alongside,’
and then my blood run cold. I thought, ‘They
know that I’m on board here, because why, they’ll have
sent the description and that. It would have gone quicker
by post than we could have come.’ So I stayed down
by my bull and presently, when we got the bull ashore,
there was a policeman, at least he didn’t look like what we
should call a policeman. He stopped me, but luckily for
me there was the captain there and he knew me and he said,
‘He’s come with the bull.’ And so I went with that bull;
oh, a matter of five hundred miles, I should think. I
don’t know where we didn’t get to. I come to a very nice
place. I never see more rabbits than were in that place,
though they weren’t rabbits neither, come to think of it:
I thought, ‘If I had got old pin-fire and my two ferrets,
I’d have some of you fine chaps.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that’s seven years ago, and I’ve been up and
down since, and I’m married to one of these foreigners
now. Isabella her name is. I don’t understand what she
says half the time, because she don’t talk any Christian
language. And we live in Medinas Close, Cercado as they
call it, but it means close, three floors up, number 41;
where we’ve got a room, and, if ever you want me, Mr.
Highworth, it’s the middle room of three, and there’s no job
I can’t turn my hand to; or if you want an English body-servant,
it wouldn’t matter my having a wife, because I
knowed your father, Mr. Highworth, Squire William, and
I know all about this land, in case you wish to know.
There’s goings on and there’s goings on, but what I once
say a white man is a white man, isn’t he? You can’t get
away from that. Isn’t he a white man? And why did
the Lord make him a white man, do you suppose? Why,
so that he shouldn’t be a black man, I suppose. Very well
then, there’s fine goings on. I don’t say a word against
black men. There’s very good ones here, very cheerful
sort of people, the black men here. Only their feet—they
don’t have feet like we do. The leg-bone comes down in
the middle of the boot, not at the end, like with us. But,
when you get used to that, they’re very nice, cheerful
people; they wouldn’t do you any harm. You trust the
black people and they’ll trust you. No, it’s these yellow
fellows, those are the ones, and there’s queer goings on.
Now, look there, look there, Master Highworth Foliat
Ridden, there’s what I don’t like to see, those yellows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that moment the carriage had to draw to the pavement.
There came a noise of a barbaric music of rattles,
drums and gongs, to which cavalry were marching. A
column in twos came slouching by the carriage. They were
led by an almost naked yellow savage who wore scarlet
plumes in his hair. The music followed him, swaying from
side to side or giving little leaps in their seats from the
excitement of the rhythm. After the music came the
troop of perhaps fifty savages, carrying red pennoned
lances. They wore nothing which could be called uniform,
except the metal moons over their mouths. Some wore
linen coats or drawers, some had ponchos or serapes.
They were smoking, singing and calling out to the
passers-by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There,” Ezekiel said, “they’re the yellows. Tents of
Shem, I call it. They all got lids to their mouths. Government’s
made those yellow soldiers; and they come in,
hundreds of them. Now, Government doesn’t see them
in the way we see them; they don’t live with Government
the way they live with us. But these yellow fellows,
they’ve been brought into this here city, and they don’t
look Christians do they, and they aren’t Christians. And
why aren’t they Christians? Because they’re cannibals.
And they’ve been billeted down Medina Close, and what
do you think they say they’ve come here for? They’re
going to eat baked Christians, they say, baked Christians!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said all this in a broad English country dialect, mixed
up with scraps of Spanish and emphasised by a lot of
signs, which no doubt could be understood by Isabella.
Hi thought that the man was as mad as a hatter as well
as being a murderer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not quite like being with a mad murderer, even
though it was seeing life, but it smote him to the heart to
see the poor old fellow weeping at the sight of him, and
swearing to be drunk that night, even if it took the burial
money: his heart warmed to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They drove through a square where a squadron of
Pituba lancers, newly arrived in town, were forming a
bivouac. These men looked as though they had been on
a foray. Some of them had newly-slaughtered sheep
slung across their horses in front of them, others had big
round loaves of army bread or, in some cases, chickens,
on their lance-points. They rode uncared-for, wiry, evil
little horses of a pale sorrel colour. They rode with a
leather thong instead of reins. Most of them had no
stirrups, but knotted leather thongs, hanging from the
saddles, which they clutched between their toes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Master Highworth,” ’Zeke said, “I don’t expect
anything from you, neither now nor any time. You’re a
great gentleman and you don’t want to come and speak
with a murderer; not that he was a murderer. And why
wasn’t it a murder? Because old Jackson, he was a rebel,
and he fired at me, didn’t he, and he’d got a better gun than
me, didn’t he, and he shot me through the gaiters, didn’t he,
and besides it wasn’t a hare I was after, it was a fox, and he
knew that as well as I, and I didn’t know, not really, when
old pin-fire would go and when he wouldn’t, for the matter
of that. But Number 41 Medinas Close, three floors up.
Don Crust they calls me and my wife Señora Crust. Anybody
knows me. I could tell you of queer goings on, very queer;
things you’d want to know, so as you could watch out,
Master Ridden. But there’s another thing, Master Highworth;
you wouldn’t want to come to Medinas Close not
after dark, not in your good things. It’s always safer to
wear a poncho—because why? Why then, if they come
at you, you’ve got something to stop it with. It isn’t
like these ordinary tight things. You can’t really tell where
a man ends inside a blanket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Besides, there’s another thing, Master Highworth, which
I wouldn’t tell to everyone; but old Keeper Jackson’s
forgiven me. He didn’t at first, not he. In the night, he
used to come to me, ‘Darn ’ee,’ he said, ‘I’ll have ’ee yet,’
he said. He used to come all sideways at me with his
blue teeth at first; not quite at first, you understand,
Master Highworth; for he must have been a bit confused
at first, from old pin-fire and being in the moon, but it was
when I was with the bull he began to come. Many a shiny
night he come at me. ‘You come back,’ he said, ‘you best
come quiet, or darn ’ee I’ll make ’ee come.’ And he done
his best to make me come; there were temptations come
to make me go back, but I saw through them. But he lost
track of me among this new religion. He didn’t know the
lingo or something, or else their tiddlewinks upset him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then one night he come again; be blest if he didn’t
come again. But he didn’t come like he ever come afore.
He come in sort of shiny, not what you would call an angel,
Mr. Ridden and sir, but he hadn’t so many teeth as the
other times, if you understand what I mean. ‘Darn ’ee,
Rust,’ he says to me, ‘you’ve given me a bad go in Tencombe
graveyard, along of all them damned and women.
But I’m out of sitting there,’ he said, ‘and I don’t mind
about it now, like I did. It’s a darned poor snipe,’ he said,
‘could sit on a grave seven years and bear malice at the
end. Besides,’ he said, ‘I’m going; they’ve given me a
horse, and I’m off in the morning.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He wouldn’t tell me where he was off to. He was
always one of they artful ones. ‘I thought I’d tell ’ee I
was going,’ he said, ‘there’s a whole lot of us got horses.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But 41 Medinas Close is where you’ll find me, Master
Hi; it isn’t a nosegay, nor anything to please the eye. It’s
back of the cathedral, not dead back of it, for that’s the
Bishop’s, but keep to the right of that, and then there’s a
gate, but you mustn’t take that, for it don’t lead anywhere,
but bear round, and then you’ll come to a place stinks
like chemicals, for it is chemicals; only you don’t go in
there, but more round, if you understand, till you come into
Two Brothers Fountain Lane. Well, it isn’t far from
there. Two naked brothers in a fountain; you’d think
they’d a-been ashamed; but these foreigners don’t know
the value of clothes the same way that we do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did you know me?” Hi asked. “I was only ten
or eleven when you saw me last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Master Highworth, I’ve known all your family since I
don’t know when. I know your blessed great-grandfather,
when he wore his pigtail. But use is second nature, as we
say; they all wore pigtails, come to think of it. Then I
know old Mr. William and Master Rowton, not your
brother Master Rowton, but your father’s, the squire’s,
older brother that was. Lord, he was a proper one, Master
Rowton. ‘A horse can jump anything,’ he used to say,
‘if you want him to.’ Well, he wouldn’t take warnings;
not once, nor twice, so the third time they bring him home
on a door. That was jumping into that pit at Beggar’s
Ash. Old Mr. William didn’t say much about his son, but
he took on about the six-year-old, for he’d backed him in
a race.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So when I seen ’ee, I said, ‘That’s a Ridden out of the
Foliats,’ I said; ‘don’t tell me, because it can’t be anybody
else. And it won’t be Mr. Chilcote, for Mr. Chilcote keeps
his lip cocked up, and besides, this is too young for Mr.
Chilcote. And Mr. Rowton’s got a swelled mouth, like old
Mr. William had the same, almost as though he’d had a
smack on it, so it won’t be him. It’s young Mr. Highworth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi promised to see him within a few days. He did not
like to offer the old man money, but contrived to make him
a present, partly as a wedding present, partly to celebrate
his meeting with a Tencombe man. He found himself in an
upper room of the hotel, looking out on an array of roofs
from which washing was hanging. Somehow, the washing
looked more romantic in that bright light than it had ever
looked in England. He was cheered at being at last an
independent man of the world. He had had a lovely
voyage, and at the end of it there had been this welcome,
from one who knew all his people and the land from which
he came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His room had a scarlet carpet and a red plush rocking-chair,
which seemed out of place in that climate, already as
hot as an English May. The walls, which had been white,
were marked with dirty fingers. Somebody, who had
occupied the room earlier that morning, had smoked cigars
in it. Bitten ends of cigar were in a flower-pot near the
window. The place seemed frowsy, untidy and feckless.
The mosquito-curtains over his bed were smeared with the
bloody corpses of old mosquitoes. All round the room,
wherever the carpet failed to reach the wall, little pale
yellow ants came and went. He sat down upon his bed,
feeling suddenly homesick; then, realising that there were
three electric fans in the room, he set them all going, knelt
down and began to unpack. He had not knelt for thirty
seconds when something bit him viciously in the leg;
glancing down, he saw a small black thing flying at great
speed along the floor. He looked at the place bitten,
which had swollen and was itching. He scratched the
place and went back to his unpacking, but was bitten
again and then again. This time, having learned to be
very swift, he slew his attacker, who smelt, when dead,
worse than he liked. Feeling indignant at being placed
in such a room, he went down to the hotel bar to see the
proprietor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Mr. Ridden,” said the proprietor, “what is it?
What can I do for you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here,” Hi said, “you’ve put me in a room all full
of bugs and things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t got a bug in the house,” the man said. “Them
ain’t bugs, them’s bichos. What you want to take is this
bottle here, called Blenkiron’s Bicho Blaster. No bicho
nor skeeto will come where Blenkiron blasts. Squirt
Blaster freely round in floor and bed, the skeetos will be
downed, the bichos dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After unpacking, Hi walked out into the city to see the
sights of the new world all shining in the sun. On the
water-front, negroes and Caribs were loading a lighter with
what looked like bunches of rusty wire: they were nearly
naked: they shone and sang. Old negresses in scarlet
turbans kept time for them by clinking bottles together.
At the south end, were the gates of what had been the
Viceroy’s garden in the old days. They stood ajar, yet
still bore the device of the horse and globe. In the garden
were flowers, butterflies like flying flowers, and birds like
jewels and flowers. Beyond the flowers was the old white
Spanish fortress, from which floated a blood-red banner,
with a golden star for each province.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad I’ve come to this place,” Hi thought, “if
only I can find something to do, I shall be as happy as the
day is long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his saunterings upon the water-front, he paused to
look into the window of a picture-dealer’s shop, which was
decked with three sketches in oil of scenes in a bull-ring.
The picture-dealer, a man with a strangely broad face, was
smoking a cigarette at his door. Hi asked him if the scenes
had been sketched in Santa Barbara. The man replied,
“You’d better inform yourself, sir.” The unusual rudeness
of the answer made Hi wonder if the man were sane: he
noted the name over the shop, and passed on, less happy
than before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet in spite of this one man’s rudeness, the morning
proved to be a long adventure of delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The narrow, busy, crowded streets, so full of life, colour,
strangeness and beauty, all lit as never in England, excited
him. There were fruits and flowers, and costumes like
fruits and flowers, men from the west, Indians from the
plains and from the forest; negroes, Caribs; women in
mantillas, women with roses in their ears; men in serapes,
men hung with silver, like images in chapels; peones in
black and silver driving ox-teams; church processions
intoning Latin; all were marvellous. Yet an impression
formed in his mind that all was not well; the Indian
lancers and certain parties of foot soldiers, who looked as
though they had been rolled in brickdust, seemed to be
there for no good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the cathedral parvise, some workmen were sinking
scarlet flag-poles into sockets in the gutters. Inside the
cathedral, men were hanging scarlet draperies all round the
sanctuary; Hi supposed that they were making ready
for the Easter festivals. “They’re beginning early,” he
thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Near the cathedral was the green in which the palace
stood. “Palacio,” a guide, explained to him. “This is
the palace of President Lopez.” He had never seen a
palace before; he stopped to stare at it. The guards at
the gate wore scarlet serapes; they rode white horses so
bitted with heavy silver that Hi longed to protest. The
palace was a big, squat, yellow building; at one end of it
was a glittering pinnacle still surrounded by scaffolding.
“I’ve heard of that,” Hi thought, “that’s his silver building.
I’ll bet it isn’t silver, though; but quicksilver. I suppose
the President is inside there somewhere, because the flag is
flying.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was now drawing towards noon. Men in evening dress,
wearing scarlet rosettes or sashes, were driving to the gates,
dismounting from their carriages, and entering the palace
precincts, either for a cabinet meeting or for lunch. Some
of these people were cheered by the onlookers, especially one
man, who had the look of a “spoiled priest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At noon, some gunners in red fired a noon-gun in front of
the palace; instantly throughout the city there came a
change in the noise of the day as though everyone had
ceased suddenly from work and pattered out to dinner.
Hi returned to his hotel, to lunch upon foods which were
strange to him: okra, manati, water-melon and a sangaree
of limes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After lunch, he wrote to his mother and to Señora
Piranha, to say that he had arrived. Having posted these
letters, he set out to the offices of the Sugar Company,
to present his letter to Mr. Roger Weycock, who received
him very kindly and asked him to dine that night at the
Club.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know any other Englishman here?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve a letter to Mr. Allan Winter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s lucky. He’s in town. He was here a few
minutes ago; we’ll get him to dine with us. Oh, all
the English here belong to the Club; we must see about
making you a temporary member. But we’ll go into that
to-night, shall we, at the Club?”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>At dinner at the Club that night, Mr. Weycock introduced
Hi to Mr. Allan Winter, who was a grizzled and rugged soul,
of long standing as a sugar-planter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll call for you at eight to-morrow,” he said, “and
drive you out to my place, where you will see the sort of
place it is.” Seeing that Hi was perplexed, he added,
“But perhaps you’re doing something else to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, thanks, sir,” Hi said, “but I’ve written to a friend
to say that I shall be here all day to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, have you friends in Santa Barbara?” Mr. Weycock
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know a girl,” Hi said. “Miss Rosa Piranha, sir.
Perhaps if you know her you can tell me if she’s in town?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you know Miss Piranha, do you?” Mr. Weycock
said. “I suppose you met her in England?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A change came on Mr. Weycock’s face, as though the
subject were unpleasant to him. “I have met her,” he
said, “but I do not know whether she’s in town or not.
You see, Ridden, my work brings me into touch with the
dynamic party, the Reds, now in power here. I am not well
in favour with people like the Piranhas. You can always
call on the Piranhas. I would go with Winter to-morrow,
if I were you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d love to,” Hi said, “but I don’t feel quite free.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I see your point,” Mr. Winter said. “You aren’t
quite free. So don’t decide now. I’ll call at eight to-morrow
and you can come if you can. You may have had
an answer by then. Leave it like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi asked why so many soldiers were in the city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Precaution,” Mr. Weycock said; “the Reds, the
present Government, are being threatened by the Whites.
The feeling is running very high.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think it ought to run high,” Mr. Winter said,
“when these gangs of cannibals are imported to keep order.
I never saw such a set of ruffians in my life. ‘I will not
ask what the disease be, the cure being what it is.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are surely as civilised,” Mr. Weycock said, “as
some of these Whites, who would burn heretics here to-morrow
if they had their will. Besides, you must know,
Winter, that the Pitubas have always been allies here.
They helped the Spaniards in the Conquest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve nothing against that,” Winter said. “But whatever
my politics were, if I were a white citizen here, seeing
those yellow cannibals brought in to keep me in order, would
make me want to shoot someone. But I don’t meddle with
politics here and, I hope, never will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not meddle in them,” Mr. Weycock said, “but I’m
bound to watch them for the sake of the firm. I only hope
that the measures taken will be sufficient. It would be a
disaster to this Republic if Don Lopez were to be killed
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Killed,” Mr. Winter said, “killed and disaster?
Rats.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m glad you take that cheery view.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this, they put away all thought of Red and White,
but dined and were merry. Hi was introduced to several
very good fellows; he was nominated for election at the
next ballot and admitted to the Club privileges pending
election. He passed a very pleasant evening. As he
walked back to his hotel, he thought that he had never
passed so wonderful a day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I may spend my life here,” he thought. “It may
not have the charm of engineering; but it must be wonderful
to pass one’s days in a place so beautiful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet as he walked, he saw three Pituba lancers dragging
a white man to a divisional gaol, which had its entrance
on the water-front. The sight angered him strangely;
and again he had the feeling that things were wrong in the
land. “There are strange goings on,” old Rust had said;
“they’re going to eat baked Christians.” He noticed the
looks of citizens who watched the dragging, and the looks
of other citizens watching for looks of disapproval. “I’ll
ask Rosa about all this,” he thought. “There ought to be
a letter from her in the morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no letter from her in the morning, but Mr.
Winter called and drove him out to his plantation at
Quezon.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch3'>III</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>D</span>uring</span> the drive, he asked Winter if he feared
any civil trouble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes and no,” he said. “The Whites and
Reds always bicker a bit at Easter; they go out of their
way to do it. They’ll do it this year. But it will be
nothing. And my advice to you is to pay no attention
to politics here, unless you’re naturalised. I’m not a
citizen, and don’t intend to be, so I keep clear of both
parties. What you want to steer clear of in this country
are foreigners with axes to grind, like Weycock’s old uncle.
I say nothing against young Weycock; he’s friendly and
decent, and all that, but when I hear him boosting the
Reds I wonder how much his uncle’s had to make
him sing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he said that Lopez was in fear of being murdered
by the Whites.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rats. The Whites won’t murder Lopez; they’ve got
no one to put in his place, and they know it. Besides,
they know that it isn’t Lopez who is running this land, but
the foreign firms who’ve put money into it and mean to
get it back. As for Lopez being afraid of being murdered,
I say, rats again. He’s afraid of nothing, from hell-fire
up; never has been.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi spent a happy day at Quezon, slept there, and was
driven back to his hotel the next morning. “You go in
and see your friends,” Mr. Winter said, “then come out
here again and spend a week or two. Everything’s hard
work here, like everywhere else. A lot of these young
bloods come out here thinking life’s going to dances and
belonging to the Cocktail Club. You’re too wise for that
foolishness; you’ve got some sense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now just let me say this, I stand in <span class='it'>loco parentis</span>
here, mind. Don’t accept a job from the United Sugar
people without just coming and talking it over with me.
They may have nothing for you, of course. They’re in
with a very queer set, who aren’t out for sugar or any other
kind of sweetness, but just both hands in the till. I see
their workings, and I know. The matter with Lopez is
not that he’s afraid, but that he’s too darned indolent to
watch their steps a little.”</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he returned to the hotel, Hi found no letter from
the Piranhas. “No answer,” he thought. “She’s had
time enough for a dozen answers. It means that she’s out
of town. Yet Rosa, in her last letter, said that she would
be in town now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wandered out into the streets, where the work and
beauty of a seaport filled every yard with wonder. He
felt that he could never tire of a life so varied, so full of
colour, passed in such light. Yet again the people gave
him the impression that all was not well. He was a newcomer,
who saw the game from outside, with fresh eyes.
He felt that the Whites and Reds were certainly going out
of their ways to bicker at this coming Easter. On his way
back to the hotel, he saw some Red officials sacking (as it
seemed) a little newspaper office. A young American, who
seemed amused at his want of grasp of the case, explained
that the cops were pulling the joint and pinching the editor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dunno. He’s one of these White guys. I guess he
wrote something some big bug didn’t quite stand for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He watched the sack to its completion. He could tell
from the looks on people’s faces what their politics were,
and his heart went out to the under dogs, the Whites, who
were outnumbered there, and dared not show all that they
felt. “Rosa is a White,” he thought, “I’ll get her to
tell me what is going on.”</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was just about to lunch at his hotel, when a negro
waiter, who seemed impressed by something, came to tell
him, chiefly by signs, that he was wanted in the foyer.
Wondering what he could have done wrong, or what could
cause the negro’s manner, he went out to the foyer, where
a footman, in a green and white livery, very politely told
him, in Spanish and pantomime, that there was something
very important for him, seemingly outside the doors.
Looking as the footman’s signs directed, he saw an old
carriage, in which two ladies sat, beneath green parasols.
“Rosa,” he thought, “Rosa and her mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the ladies was old, with white hair; she sat
upright with an absorbed look as though she were praying.
The other was Rosa, but changed indeed from the Rosa
of the Foliats; this creature was painted into a kind of
purple mask with high lights of white powder on her nose.
Over her eyes, arches of plainly false eyebrows had been
put in with the brow-stick. Great gold ear-rings, enclosing
green stones, hung from her ears, her mouth was scarlet.
He had never seen a more raddled-looking baggage, yet
this was the Rosa of four months before, who had galloped
hatless astraddle before breakfast with him. Both ladies
turned to him at once with an air which made him feel
ashamed that he had no hat to take off to them and very
thankful that he hadn’t. The old lady was more subtly
made up than her daughter, but even she seemed to wear
a mask or glaze of enamel. “I suppose it’s the fashion
here,” he thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Glaze or not, they were plainly great ladies here, conferring
incredible honour upon the hotel. Half the staff
was there to attend their pleasure already. The Señora
held her hand for Hi to kiss (his good angel guarded him
from shaking it), she bade him welcome in English. He
had not seen her since he was a little child, but he remembered
her clearly, as Donna Emilia, a lady who held
herself very straight and was always praying. “She
needed not to have made up,” Hi thought. “There is
something very beautiful in her face.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Welcome,” she said; “your father has been a good
friend to us. You and yours have been good friends to
Rosa. I hope that all your household was well when you
left England. Let me see you, Highworth. You are liker
your mother than your father. But my eyes are failing, I
cannot be sure of this. Come now, with us, will you, to
spend some hours at our house?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should love to,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go and get your hat, then, and put it on,” Rosa said.
“Never, never come out without a hat again. Put it on
at once, or this sun will skin you. It doesn’t come through
a watery envelope as it does in England. That is your
vanity, wanting to look brown. You wouldn’t look brown,
you’d crack, and all your poor little brains would pop.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They drove down the water-front, past the Viceroy’s
garden, to the gate. Several houses on the water-front
were displaying the scarlet banners, starred with gold, which
Lopez had declared to be the national flag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there to be some sort of celebration?” Hi asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A display, I understand,” Donna Emilia said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How wonderful the bay looks with the shipping,” Rosa
said quickly. “Do you see, Hi, the shallows beyond the
bay? All that southern bay is only about six feet
deep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good bathing, I should think,” Hi said. “Is one
allowed to bathe there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe that some of the Indians sometimes bathe
there,” Rosa said, “but there are swarms of sharks. If
you go out in a boat, they’ll come all round you, and rub
along the side and try to tip you out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you do then?” Hi asked. “Sing them to
sleep?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The best way is to hit them a bat with the flat of an
oar-blade.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder you don’t stare at them,” Hi said. “No
shark can resist the power of the human eye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Women’s eyes excite them,” Rosa said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should have thought a haughty look would shrivel
them. The books are full of it: ‘She darted a freezing
glance at him.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this moment they were passing through the gate of
the city. On their right was a park of palms, flowers and
busts, on their left, beyond the fortress, was the approach
to the market pier, where the boats landed fish, fruit and
other produce at dawn each morning. A party of men
and women were coming from this pier with donkey carts
laden with fruits, eggs and vegetables. “They’re the
second market,” Rosa said, “they buy up the leavings from
the boats and hawk them through the closes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men of the second market recognised the liveries of
the Piranhas. They stopped their carts, stood still, uncovered
and cried, “Long live the Whites. Long live the
Whites. Let the Reds perish.” To Hi’s astonishment
neither woman took the slightest notice. They stared
ahead as though they neither saw nor heard. Hi thought
it odd that they did not bow; Rosa turned to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you see the boats, Hi?” she asked. “Those are
some of the coast boats which bring the produce. There
are many market gardens along this great shallow bay,
especially at La Boca, ten miles down. The gardeners
send their things in the boats, which are just as fast as
boats can be. They often race both ways. We can see
them from our windows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Out in the bay there was enough wind to ruffle the water.
About a dozen boats of queer rigs were rushing home under
all the sail they could set. Some were lateen-rigged with
striped sails of blue and white; most were polacca schooners
with steeved bowsprits setting a sprit beneath upon a yard.
The sails of these were of a bright orange colour. All
had high curved whaler’s bows topped with gilt emblems.
All were fast boats; even Hi was surprised at the way they
travelled. A rounded white gleam at their sides showed
their speed and the cleanness of their thrust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t they like dolphins?” Rosa said. “Don’t they
seem to enjoy it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Less than half a mile from the gate of the city they
entered the gates of the Piranhas’ estate, which lay to the
left, between the road and the sea. In the niches of the
masonry of the gates were figures of painted terra-cotta,
representing Friendship and Affection, one on each side.
They had been labelled when new, but time had destroyed
the plaster on which the labels were painted. “We can’t
tell t’other from which now,” Rosa said. “People think
they’re both the Virgin, and lay little bunches of flowers
before them on their way to work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gates were old masterpieces of wrought iron, now
frail from rust, their palm leaves were snapping, some of
their bars had worn through. All within the gates showed
the same marks of decay. It had once been an Italian
garden, but time, poverty and the sea winds had helped to
bring it to ruin. Marble busts of poets and nymphs were
fallen, or overgrown with trailers. The great red clay or
terra-cotta urns had been split by the roots of their flowers,
so that they looked like fountains of flowers falling under
the living glitter of the humming birds. The shingle of
the walk, though marked with wheels and horse-hoofs,
was almost overgrown with a thick green-leaved trailer,
full of minute blue flowers. The house was a biggish, oblong,
yellow building, with decorative panels of scarlet plaster in
the recesses of the masonry. The scarlet had faded to
pale red, it was scaley and mildewed; altogether, the house
looked out of fashion. There had been a device between
supporters over the door. The supporters were now
nothing but legs, two hairy, with paws, two human, with
feet. The device was wholly gone. Part of a label bore
the legend:</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'>non sufficit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi wondered what it was that did not suffice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the carriage stopped below the perron an old negro
with powdered hair, wearing the uniform of the Piranhas,
white with green splashes on the shoulders, came down the
steps to welcome them. He carried a long ebony cane with
a gold pineapple at the end. Hi helped Donna Emilia up the
steps. Outside the house, all things gave evidence of a
great family coming down in the world. Inside, it was all
as it had been in the time of its splendour, except that
colours had faded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come into my room, Highworth,” Donna Emilia said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She led him into a pleasant room hung with portraits
of her own and her husband’s families. She took her
seat in a great brocaded chair that was like a throne. Hi
was only a boy, but he was impressed by her bearing.
She gave him the impression of being a work of art held
together by nothing but will, and a sense of style.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi closed the door at her bidding. Rosa was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is thirty years, Highworth,” she said, “since your
father in this room brought news to my husband and myself
that our fortunes were secured in the days of the copper
crisis. My husband promised then that this house should
be a home to any of your race. There to your right you
will see a drawing of your father as he was then. It is a
pleasure to me to see you stand where your father stood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rang a little bell which stood on a table beside her;
the negro with the ebony cane appeared. “This is my old
retainer, Pablo,” she said, “faithful as one of the old age.
Pablo,” she said, “this is Mr. Highworth, whose father
you will remember. In all ways and at all times you are to
consider him as one of this household.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After Pablo had gone she turned again to Hi.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is talking beneath the surface,” she said, “which
the English do not do. Now tell me. What are your plans
for your life in this country? Your father says that you
have letters and that we are not to help you till we see that
you have helped yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have only just landed,” Hi said. “I have letters
to Mr. Weycock and Mr. Winter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To Mr. Mordred Weycock?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, his nephew.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did either Mr. Winter or Mr. Weycock tell you of
troubles impending in this country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They seemed to think that things were not perfectly
settled,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what do you yourself think, now that you have
seen them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They don’t seem quite happy somehow,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can they be happy,” she said, “with Antichrist
upon the throne? I am a woman and meddle little with
politics, but very much with religion, which is a force that
your Mr. Weycocks do not admit to exist. He and his
friends, Highworth, are rousing up in this country something
which they cannot understand, the very depths
of the soul of this people. But come, Highworth, take
this flower. Give me your arm. Open that door for me.
This is the chapel of the Piranhas; this tomb is where my
husband lies. He loved your father, who was more than
a friend to us in a time of calamity. Lay the flower upon
his tomb. He will be glad to know that your father’s son
is in this house in this time of calamity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely Señora,” he said, “the calamity is not so great.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him and could not answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leave me here a little, Highworth,” she said. “There
is a Greco over the altar. But you will not care for these
things. You will find Rosa in the garden room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was dim in the chapel. It was built of white Otorin
marble in barrel vaulting, with one piercing in the sanctuary.
Hi saw a blackness with bronze gleams where he laid his
flower. He knew that Donna Emilia was crying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O Señora,” he said. He felt that he could not stay
there: he went quickly back to the light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pablo led the way to a room full of sunlight: it opened
upon the garden, but was itself more full of flowers than the
garden, from a bank of white cuencas near the French
windows. The light poured upon these, so that every
white trumpet of the cuencas seemed to quiver with
life. Little yellow butterflies poised above the flowers. A
crested humming bird with a dazzling throat hovered in
the light near the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Hi,” Rosa said, “how are you liking Santa
Barbara?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I love it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You came in the <span class='it'>Recalde</span>, of course. When did you write
to mother; do you remember?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, the day before yesterday; a few hours after I
landed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought so,” she said. “I suppose you wondered
why we didn’t answer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you were out of town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We did not receive your letter till this morning,” she
said. “The censorship is on again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What censorship?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Government’s. You see, we are a White family.
All our people are Whites, or Surplices even, the sort of
purest of the pure. The Reds have been planning something
unusual for some time. They have been talking about
a conspiracy to kill Don Lopez and evidence of a White
rebellion. They always talk like that before a devilry.
Then they say that they were provoked to measures of
safeguard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Latterly there has been no censorship of letters; but
I was afraid that one had begun two or three days ago.
Now I am sure of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do they do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take all the letters addressed to eminent Whites to
some Red officer in the fortress; then he steams them, I
suppose, and reads them and has them photographed or
copied before they are delivered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder they take the pains,” Hi said. “If they’re
dirty enough skunks to read other people’s letters, they’re
dirty enough skunks to forge false ones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, they are; but they like to know what is going on,
as well as what they imagine. Don’t speak of these things
to mother, or before her, Hi, if you don’t mind. I’m
afraid I rather shut you up when you asked about the
celebrations. But mother hasn’t been well for some time.
She thinks that something terrible is happening; or soon
going to happen. Any allusion to the Reds just now
upsets her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right,” Hi said, “I’ll be silent. But I say, Rosa; I
wish you’d tell me why you didn’t bow or smile or anything
when those market people cheered you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did it seem very bad manners?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It struck me as a little odd.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re Whites,” she answered. “We’re watched pretty
closely. What is to stop the Reds from sending agents
to cheer the Whites in our presence, and watching whether
we applaud? What would stop them arresting us for
fomenting party feeling or ‘encouraging White excesses,’
as they would call it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They couldn’t,”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not? What is to stop them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For smiling and bowing just because people cheer
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Hi, and for even looking as though you wished to
smile and bow. ‘Gestures prejudicial to civil peace,’ is
the phrase they use, or ‘conduct deemed to be provocative
of civil disturbance,’ that is another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Arrest you and your mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, rather; like billio.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, good Lord, what are the Whites doing to let
these Reds do these things? They must be jugginses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There aren’t many Whites on this side of Santa
Barbara: the Whites are all in the west.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; but they must know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t so easy as it sounds. The Whites did a lot
of stupid things when they were in power; trying to stop
the Schools Acts and other Acts which the Reds had just
passed; naturally the Reds were furious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; but hang it all, Rosa, stopping a sort of Act of
Parliament is done in a civilised way, by law; but these
Reds have brought in all these yellow devils. I can’t see
why the Whites allow that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Pitubas? We’re used to them here. They’re
not so bad as they look. They don’t eat all the babies
they’re credited with. They may munch a finger here
and there. What I mind is the censorship and the spying,
and the knowledge that all the time these Red officers are
making dossiers against all whom one holds dear: false
dossiers, with forged evidence, which they may use.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should they use them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You haven’t seen the gang who governs us? They are
in touch with a set of people who want to ‘open up’ this
land, as they call it and will pay for the privilege. Naturally,
they would get their money back a hundredfold.
Since the Whites stand in the way, naturally the Reds want
to get rid of them; and the dirty way is the way the Reds
take by nature, being what they are, people without dignity
and without belief.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know anything about it, of course,” Hi said,
“but I should have thought it would be a good thing to get
opened up a bit: have a few more railways and get more
of the land under cultivation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If a gang of scoundrels came down on England, to open
England up a bit, would you like that, Hi?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father always says that that is what is always happening
in England, so I suppose we are used to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we aren’t. Now I’ve got heaps to do. I’ve got
to cut all this linen to pattern for our children’s Easter
frocks. So although you may not think it a manly job,
I want you to help me at it, will you, like a brick? We’ll
open this linen up a bit to make little panties for our
bambini.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi was always ready for any job. They set to work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the way, Hi,” Rosa said, “my cousin, Carlotta de
Leyva, will be here at lunch. She talks English, so you
needn’t be scared.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shan’t be scared, if she’s anything like you,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, she isn’t, worse luck,” Rosa said. “But I thought
I’d have you alone to warn you. Carlotta is a very special
person. She’s not like anybody else; but it’s no good your
falling in love with her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” he said; “I shan’t fall in love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It won’t be any good if you do,” she said. “Carlotta
is to be married from here in less than a month. By the
way, you’ll have to come to the wedding, heretic or no.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is she marrying?” he asked; not that he cared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don Manuel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A sort of local buck?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would call him that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has he a surname?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Encinitas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought that was a province.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it is: he owns most of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And she owns most of the province next to it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her brother does.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So when the two marry, they will control about half
of Santa Barbara between them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why shouldn’t they, if they are wise and good?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems rather a lot for two; what sort of a man is
Don Manuel; a good sort?” Rosa made a grimace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He hasn’t done much good yet. Even if he had, he
wouldn’t be good enough for her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is what women always say before a wedding,”
he said, “ ‘.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of course he isn’t good enough for her.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any man before his wedding will say it’s true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Men in love will agree to anything. I say, Rosa,
is there anything I ought not to do at lunch?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any local custom?” she said. “Yes, we don’t eat with
our knives and we always cluck as we swallow to show how
much we are enjoying it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; I say Rosa, you’re always ragging. What ought I
not to do? You might tell a fellow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve warned you, Hi: not to fall in love with my
cousin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fall in love: rats,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the spirit,” she said. “Rats.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Someone in the hall outside was moving to and fro,
arranging flowers in the bowls on the tables. At first,
Hi thought that this was Donna Emilia; then the unseen
woman began to sing in a low voice, as though thinking
of something else. It was not Donna Emilia. Hi could
not make out the words, but thought the voice and tune
pretty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the song, Rosa?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That? An old lullaby. It’s about roses going to bed
because it’s late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s pretty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear boy, you’re cutting that thing so that it’ll
have neither cut nor hang.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, dash it, so I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You pay attention to what you’re doing and never
mind about lullabies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently, after the song had stopped, something bumped
upon the door; the voice of the singer called to them in
English to “open the door, please.” Hi opened the door.
A woman stood on the threshold, holding a jar full of sprays
of white stellas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve brought these for you, Rosa,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s sweet of you,” Rosa said. “You two haven’t
met yet. Carlotta, this is Mr. Highworth Ridden, an old
flame of mine. He’s helping me to cut panties; men do
these things in England. Hi, this is my cousin, Señorita
de Leyva.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you do, Mr. Ridden?” Carlotta said. “Will
you take these flowers for me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said something in broken Spanish and took the jar
to the table; the stellas were the sweetest flowers he had
ever known. In a gush of memory he saw a hedge of
honeysuckle at home in June. At the table, he turned to
look at Carlotta, who was unlike anyone he had ever seen.
“She’s an angel of Paradise,” he thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had not thought of women; until that moment he
had never bothered his head about them. He had considered
them as a race apart, with ways of their own
which, on the whole, he resented. From time to time he
had met a girl who had been a jolly good sport: Rosa was
rather a good sport; anyhow, they were the exceptions. The
rest were in a world of their own, with nerves and standards
of their own which he disliked but respected. Now suddenly
there stood before him a woman who realised all his
dreams of what a woman should be. Yet she was not like
any other woman. She was as little like a woman as a
humming bird is like a bird. She was a small, perfect,
spiritual shape, glowing like a humming bird. He had once
heard somebody say that “you only get perfection in small
things”; he had thought the man an ass at the time, but
remembered it now. This woman was perfect. Her hair
was of a most deep, dark brown, very abundant, but
caught close to her head by a narrow fillet of gold. This
gave her something the look of a boy, enough, perhaps, to
establish a sympathy with a boy like Hi. The eyes were
darker than the hair. They shone as though the brain
behind them were one glow of light. They were not only
kind, good eyes, but so very merry. The eyebrows were
remarkable. As in most clever faces, the base of her nose,
at the brow, was broad, and the space between the eyes not
small. The unusual beauty of the eyebrows was their
length; they continued the demarcation of the brow to
the right and left; they were straight in line over the eyes,
and lifted a little at the right and left sides, in a way
impossible to describe, though it made the face most vivid
and unusual. The nose was straight. The ears, which
are seldom beautiful, even in the beautiful, were perfect
in her. The cheeks were of a rich colour as though the
life within were very intense. The mouth was the great
distinction: it was of a faultless beauty. All fun, all
thoughtfulness, all generosity, were in those gentle, sensitive,
proud curves. She wore white, with a green jacket.
Her voice seemed to Hi to be the quality of voice he had
always most longed to hear. She spoke English faultlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So Rosa has put you to cutting out Easter dresses?”
she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Women are always making men slaves,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, after lunch, you shall be free. Manuel will be
here to lunch, Rosa, so if it’s cool enough we might play
tennis afterwards. Would you play, Mr. Ridden?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d love some tennis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She picked up some pattern-paper, turned it, folded it,
snipped it with scissors, refolded it, snipped it again, and
then shook it out as a sort of cape or shawl of lace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is what the negresses wear in San Jacinto,” she
said. “They cut the linen and wear it over scarlet; it
looks just like lace at a little distance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are clever,” Hi said, “to cut it all out like that.
I wish you’d show me how you did it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like this,” she said, picking up another piece of paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The English are always wanting to do things,” Rosa
said. “They never say, ‘Here’s a perfect day, let’s think
about perfection.’ They say, ‘Here, it’s stopped raining,
let’s do something.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You did your share when you were in England,” he
said, “so you needn’t talk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She seems to have been busy this morning,” Carlotta
said. “We’ll talk about perfection, if you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to talk, but to listen,” Rosa said. “Suppose
you sing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carlotta went to the piano and sang a couple of Spanish
songs, one strange, the other grim, both haunting. Hi
thought them the most beautiful things he had ever
heard, sung by the most marvellous voice. He could not
turn his eyes from her face and throat. She was the most
exquisite thing he had ever seen. He felt himself to be vile
and a boor, and unfit to walk the same planet. He
wondered whether he could possibly take the pattern-papers
which she had cut, or the scissors she had used.
He stared and stared. He knew it to be rude, but could
not help it. “My God, she is beautiful,” he thought.
“She is lovely, lovely. O God, I wish I could fight for her
or do something for her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He noticed her hands. They were not the thin, pale,
very knuckly bundles of skewers which ladies’ hands usually
seemed to him, but perfections of form and marks of
capacities. There was a ring on one finger. “There it is,”
he thought; “she’s engaged to be married, to this devil
Manuel, who isn’t good enough for her. This devil Manuel
can kiss her. I’d like to call him out.” Glancing suddenly
away from the lovely face he saw Rosa watching him with
a certain malice tinged just a little, unselfish as she was,
with envy. No one had stared at her in quite that way
before she had taken any pains to secure it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosa smiled somewhat bitterly; a gong was beaten to
call them to lunch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Manuel is late,” Carlotta said; “he said he might be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi hated Manuel for being late, and for being called
“Manuel,” and for being at all. He wanted to shine before
her, but could think of nothing to say; he seemed to be
spurting orange-juice everywhere. Then he was ashamed
that three women, living in this lovely room, should all
speak good English, in compliment to himself, while he
could hardly say, “Thank you” in Spanish.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>“R</span>osa,</span> my daughter,” Donna Emilia said, “I have
had such a strange message from Señora
Artigas. Her son, Estifanio, has disappeared.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We passed him in the cathedral last night, mother, at
about six or half-past, as we left the service.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was at home after that. At nearly midnight two
young men, in evening dress, called for him to say that
Porfirio Rivera, his great friend, had been hurt in a duel,
was dying, and had asked for him. Estifanio did not know
the young men; but, of course, he went with them, and
he has not returned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If his friend were dying, mother, he would stay with
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the story was false, my dear. Porfirio called for
Estifanio this morning; he had fought no duel, is in
perfect health, and has sent no message. Estifanio has
disappeared. Imagine his mother’s anxiety.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi saw Rosa and Carlotta look at each other with
a glance which he could not interpret. He felt that there
was trouble and that he had better say something.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We had a fellow at school,” he said, “who disappeared
one summer holidays. He went out in a boat with another
fellow. The boat upset, but they were picked up by
a steamer. However, the steamer was carrying the mails
and could not stop, so these two fellows had to go all the
way to New York before they could send a message home.
They’d both been buried, or at least had the burial-service
read over them by that time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Estifanio will turn up, in the same way, mother,” Rosa
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I trust so,” the old lady said. “Suddenness of death
is ever a thing I pray God to spare my friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Estifanio is a great hunter,” Carlotta said. “He rides
out to this ‘drag,’ do you call it? which the English have
started. Are you fond of hunting, Mr. Ridden?” He
thought her an angel of tact to have changed the conversation
a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I love riding,” he said, “but of course, my father only
lets me ride the old crocks. Still, sometimes he lets me be
his second horseman, and then I have had some wonderful
times.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rosa said that you are fond of engines.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I love engines.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I,” she said. “I’m racing my brother with one.
He is having an irrigation canal dug by men, and I am doing
a little bit of it with machines; but the nature of the
ground doesn’t make it quite a fair match. What engines
interest you most?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No particular engine,” he said, “but more the nature
of engines. I’m always thinking of all sorts of little engines
which everybody could have. For instance, a little engine
to sweep the floor of a room, or dust walls, or clean big glass
panes like the windows of shops. Then, I expect you’ll
think it very silly, but don’t you think one could have
a little engine on a boat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, the engine on a boat,” Rosa said. “Hi is a lovely
character, Carlotta. He would die for me or for you at
a moment’s notice; but the engine on a boat is his mad
streak. Of course it’s nice to have a mad streak; it shows
the oldness of your family; but there it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should there not be an engine on a boat?”
Carlotta asked. “What sort of little engine do you mean,
Mr. Ridden?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, call him Hi, Carlotta,” Rosa said. “This is his
home here, remember; call him Hi.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know whether he will let me,” Carlotta said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be frightfully proud if you will,” Hi said, and
blushed scarlet, and knew that Rosa watched the blush.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What sort of engine .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Hi?” Carlotta asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” he said, wondering whether he would
ever be able to save her life and in reward be asked to call
her Carlotta.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see,” he said, “Rosa is always ragging. She
worked at this engine when she was in England. You see,
we live in a part of England which is mostly rolling grass
hills. We call them downs, but they are really a sort of
ups. Well, we are a good long way from the Thames;
too far to go for a day’s boating. Now I’m not much good
at rowing, but I do love messing about in a boat. I mean,
being in a boat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do, too,” Carlotta said; “there is a sort of lake at
home. I go out in a boat to watch the flamingoes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve not got any lake, alas,” Hi said, “but there is
a little sort of brook, or chalk-stream. It’s got plenty of
water always, but it isn’t broad enough for oars. So what
I’ve always wanted to do is to make a little engine to go in
a boat. I don’t mean a steam-engine, but a hand engine,
so that one could have the exercise of rowing. A man
would sit on the thwart and turn a crank, or pull it to and
fro, and that would turn a paddle-wheel; only I don’t
want the paddle-wheel to be at the side, but either in front
or let into the boat in a sort of well, so as not to take up
room. They all say that it couldn’t go, but I say it must
go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course it would go,” Carlotta said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How could it go?” Rosa asked. “It could no more
go than if you were to stand in the boat and pull the boat-rope.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve not even got enough mechanical sense, Rosa,”
Hi said, “to make you keep quiet when mechanics are
being talked. If I’d had an old boat or punt to experiment
on, instead of a clothes-basket covered with rick-cloth,
I’d have proved that my thing would go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it would go, why hasn’t it been done? All the
English are always messing about in boats.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My engine is not for ordinary rivers, but for the brooks
at home, or even the canals, where you cannot always row,
nor even paddle in comfort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There wasn’t much comfort in your clothes-basket, if
I remember rightly,” Rosa said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There isn’t much comfort in any good thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should have thought religion,” Rosa said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You try it and see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Manuel is very late,” Donna Emilia said. “We’re
almost at an end here. Do you think that he will come,
’Lotta?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I think I hear him.” A horse came at a quick
canter up the drive. Carlotta turned to Hi.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After my marriage,” she said, “you must come out to
stay with us, if you will. There are rivers there not unlike
what I should imagine yours to be, and rolling hills of
grass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would love that,” he said. He looked at her, and
was at once shot through with anguish to think that she
was to be married to a man not good enough for her.
“He has frightened her,” he thought, “or got some hold
upon her, in the way these beasts do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly he realised that Don Manuel was there, kissing
Donna Emilia’s hand; he must have come in like a panther.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say,” he thought, “what a man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All manly strength, beauty and grace moved in that
figure; but the face was the extraordinary thing; it won
Hi at once, partly by its power, partly by its resemblance
to the bust of the young Napoleon on the landing at the
Foliats. The man turned to Hi, with eyes most strange,
masterful, unbearable and bright as flames. “This is an
extraordinary man,” Hi thought. “Either splendid or
very queer, perhaps both.” The extraordinary man
greeted him in English; then burst out with:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, I am glad to see you, Mr. Ridden. Your father
sixteen years ago sent me two English hunting saddles,
because I rode his stallion, what? And how is your
father? And how do you like Santa Barbara? Ah, your
father; I was proud of those saddles; no gift have I liked
so. You shall come to me at Encinitas and ride and ride.
That is the life, what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took Hi’s hands in both his own, in his impulsive
way, and looked into his eyes, in a way that was both
frightening and winning; it entirely won Hi.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not a bit like your father,” he said, “not a little
bit. Your father likes being top-dog; sometimes bully,
sometimes blarney. You want to make things. I know
your sort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are you staying?” he continued. “At the
Santiago? That’s a vile hole, the Santiago. Yet all our
visitors form their first impressions there. Whereabouts
have they put you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the third floor,” Hi said, “Room 67.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Looking out on the back, what? Well, looking out on
the front wouldn’t have been much more cheerful. The
palace, the Santiago and the cathedral. I’d like to raze
them all three and start afresh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the way, about your Santiago. I am a night bird.
I pass the back of that hotel at night at two in the morning.
You can get in at the back through the cellar-grating. The
negro waiters run a gambling hell there; fan-tan, what?
They also do a private trade in the hotel liquor. And now
forgive me everybody for being so late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are scandalously late, Manuel,” Rosa said. “You
deserve no lunch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want no lunch,” he said, “but coffee and some bread.
I am late, because I have been tracking a crime. Estifanio
Artigas was murdered in this city last night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then it was murder?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were talking of him a moment since.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will be death to the poor mother; her only
child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is more than this,” Carlotta said. “The murder
was planned. By whom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Murder Gang of the Palace. A club of young
criminals headed by Don José, the son of our Dictator,
Mr. Ridden. They murdered the lad in that tunnel or
passage where the windmills used to be. I have been with
the murderer. Here’s a copy of his confession, made before
Chacon, the notary. I’ve sent copies of it to Chavez and
Hermengildo, as well as to your brother, Carlotta. Who
could want food after this? Now the Whites move again;
we have a cause and a case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This Murder Club was founded by Don José at the
end of last year as a new excitement; he and eight young
men are the members; all very select. They have now
murdered five men; one a month is their rule, each in
a different way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pablo Hinestrosa was chosen to kill Estifanio. Two of
the others came to help him; four were posted, to keep
guard during the murder; the other two brought Estifanio
to the place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I learned all this from Pablo’s own lips this morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pablo Hinestrosa was always as weak as water,” Rosa
said. “Cruel, too; I remember him putting worms under
his rocking horse as a little child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I found Pablo in the street, as I came back from my
ride this morning,” Don Manuel continued. “He was
crying and quaking; so I brought him to my rooms. Bit
by bit, I got the story out of him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One moment, Manuel,” Carlotta said; “this Hinestrosa
man, who is plainly of weak intelligence, may have imagined
all this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, no, alas,” Don Manuel said, “I have proved it to
be true. One decoyed the victim to the carriage, one drove
the carriage to the tunnel. Then the decoy led him into
the tunnel, where Pablo killed him. Don José helped in
the killing. There were the tracks and the body, everything
corresponded exactly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will think this next a strange thing:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don José is very clever as well as very vicious. He
and Spallo took Pablo home after the murder, and, as they
saw that he was shaken, they feared that he would betray
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now Pablo feared that they feared this, so he contrived
to leave them where he could hear them talking. He heard
Don José say: ‘I knew that he would be sentimental.
He will confess the whole thing to the first priest he can find.
Shall we finish him? It would be rather a neat end to
the night.’ It must have been an anxious moment for
Pablo, waiting for the answer; but Spallo said, ‘Better
not.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He’ll be all right after a sleep.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After that, Spallo and José went away, but now another
strange thing happened. When they had gone (so Pablo
says) the ghost of Estifanio’s father came in and sat beside
him. He never spoke, but whenever Pablo tried to run
from the room, this ghost slid in front of him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What happened then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pablo said that he ‘burned the ghost away, with
matches and texts of Scripture.’ When the ghost was gone
he ran into the street; but it was worse there, he said,
because Estifanio kept looking through the windows at
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I got a doctor to give him an opiate; now he’s asleep
in Chacon’s house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God give us mercy,” Donna Emilia said. “Is there
to be no measure to the wickedness of this time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When will General Chavez know of this?” Carlotta
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now. He’ll be in town by six. Congress meets at
eight. We will arraign the palace on this question.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God help this unhappy land,” Donna Emilia said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God is helping this land,” Don Manuel said. “He gives
us this sword against the Lopez gang; now we shall end
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not so sure, Manuel,” Carlotta said. “There is
much shrewdness in the men about Lopez. They would
be only too glad to get rid of Don José. This case may rid
the land of Don José; but I do not think that Lopez will
be involved. His hands may even be strengthened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manuel listened to her with much attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not as ours are strengthened,” he said. “Chavez and
Bazan must stir at this. I have the confession and all the
evidence. The Reds suspect nothing. We shall have a <span class='it'>coup
de théâtre</span> in only five hours. This magazine shall explode
under their feet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder,” Carlotta said. “General Chavez may think
the time inopportune.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Inopportune? When the Reds are declaiming about
a White conspiracy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If not inopportune, he may find some other excuse for
not acting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He must act upon this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is a very indolent man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If he will not act, we will find who will. I see three
here to start with; no, four, for I am sure that Mr. Ridden
will be with us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather, if you’ll have me, sir,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will begin your stay here well, to help in the downfall
of a Dictator.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Manuel,” Rosa said, “you are not to drag Hi into our
party politics.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Manuel,” Carlotta said, “I think that you are going
beyond the present issue, which is, to denounce the Murder
Club. Lopez has sufficient readiness, and bigness, to
banish, or even to prosecute, his son; and then face you
in a stronger position than ever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe that Lopez is mad,” Manuel said. “To-night,
when this begins, I shall declare him to be unfit to
govern.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he spoke, the major-domo entered with a telegram
upon a salver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For Don Manuel,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Don Manuel had read the telegram, he changed
countenance; it was plain that he had received a blow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it ill news from Encarnacion?” Donna Emilia asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is your mother worse, Manuel?” Carlotta asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he said, “my beloved mother is dangerously ill
at Encarnacion. I must go at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There will be no train to San Jacinto till noon to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he said, “but I can go by the mountain train at
four; and ride from Melchior, it is only sixty-seven miles.
If I telegraph for horses, I can be at home by dusk to-morrow
night. That will save five hours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must go at once, if you are to catch the four
train,” Carlotta said. “I’ll drive you to the station.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will go, then,” Manuel said. “While they bring
the chaise, I’ll order horses; you shall send the telegrams
when I am gone.”</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Don Manuel made his farewells, he took Hi’s hand in
both his own hands. “My greetings to your father,” he
said. “Tell him I remember the saddles. I shall expect
you presently at my home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will stay with us, will you not?” Carlotta said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would love to,” Hi said. “I would love it more than
anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all went out of doors to see them start. Carlotta
was driving two marvellous little horses, full of fire. Hi
looking at her as she sat watching her horses, felt that the
only possible happiness on earth would be to live and die
for her; since everything about her was beautiful and came
not from this world. He saw that all there thought as he
thought and felt as he felt about her. “You beautiful
and gracious and glorious thing,” he thought. “I wish
I could die for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The peones stepped from the horses’ heads, the gates
opened, the horses strained to the collars and the marvellous
girl was gone. Often, afterwards, he thought of that
scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I trust that he may find his mother alive,” Donna
Emilia said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must be going, too,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Going! nonsense,” Rosa said. “You’ve come for the
day. You’ve had neither tennis nor a swim. Come in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had come in, Rosa looked at him with malice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t he handsome, Hi?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Handsome? I should think he is,” Hi said. “He is
everything and has everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; he hasn’t everything,” Rosa said. “I know
several things that he has not. But even if he had everything,
he wouldn’t be good enough for her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi did not answer, for the thought of Manuel having
the beautiful Carlotta went through him with a pang.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He wouldn’t be good enough for her; would he?”
Rosa repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you don’t,” Rosa said. “You know that he
wouldn’t. Confess, Hi, he wouldn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi looked at her with a look of pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t she wonderful?” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I understand your being fond of her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fond of her? People aren’t fond of her. They
worship her and would die for her. Wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I would,” he said, after a pause. “You know I
would. And you would, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told you not to,” Rosa said. “I gave you fair warning.
You’d better put her out of your mind. Besides,”
she added with malice, “he’s frightfully jealous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll have some cause, I should say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, come on into the garden. I’ll play you tennis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, be square, Rosa. You don’t really want me. I
must clear out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell you when to clear out,” she said. “But stay
a little. Carlotta will be back in half an hour. Stay to
see her. It will be the last time you’ll see her before she
marries.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you said that they wouldn’t be married till
Easter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not now,” she said. “She’ll go to him by the noon
train to-morrow; you will see. I shall have to go with her.
She’ll be married by the Bishop to-morrow midnight, so
that the mother may see the son married. Then she’ll
be with that man all her life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She chose him, out of all the men in the world,” he
said. “And I don’t wonder; he’s a fine fellow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A fine fellow? Only a few years ago he was the friend
of this Don José of the Murder Gang.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know about that,” Hi said. “He’s a fine
fellow now; and she thinks so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She thinks so now, but in a week, in a month .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
with that man all the time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s Pablo, with a message for you,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is someone to see you, Señorita,” Pablo said,
“Tomás Chacon, the notary from Santa Barbara.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strange,” Rosa said to Hi. “This is the notary whom
Manuel left in charge of the murderer. If you will stay
by these roses, to watch the humming birds for a moment,
I will speak to him.”</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>He watched the humming birds for ten minutes, while
Rosa spoke with the man. He did not think of the
humming birds; the love of Carlotta was eating him up,
in an agony that was yet sweet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the visitor had gone, Rosa returned to him. “I
knew that there would be trouble,” she said. “Chacon
has let the murderer escape. The Reds are warned now
and all Manuel’s plan will miscarry. He’ll be furious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did he let him escape?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Somebody betrayed it, and the Reds rescued him.
I’ve sent Chacon to tell General Chavez; but nothing will
be done now that Manuel is away: Chavez is an idler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” she added, “he may act because Manuel is
away. These soldiers and politicians are as jealous of
each other as prime donne.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely,” Hi said, “this isn’t a matter for politicians,
but for the police? Surely the police will take the
murderer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The police?” she said. “Why, Hi, they’re married
men, with families, most of them. Do you think they’d
risk their pensions by arresting a Red on a White warrant?
They’re not philanthropists.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are they, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paid partisans.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Golly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well may you say golly. However, that is a little
thing, compared with this marriage. I’m used to the
police. I’m not used to the thought of that man
with .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had paused at the little fountain, where she gazed
down into the basin and let the fingers of one hand open
and close in the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’m not going to talk in this beastly way,” she
said. “Forget what I said, will you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, Hi, you’ll come here whenever you like.
Mother told me to tell you that a place will be here for you
at lunch on every Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday; when
you can come, we’ll be glad, and when you can’t you
needn’t write or send word. You needn’t think it’s decent
of us. We’re only too glad. You were all lovely to me at
your home, and your father simply saved us from beggary.
Besides, it will be a charity to two lorn females.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” Hi said, “you’re a jolly good friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s my hand on that,” she said. “And when
you’re settled out here, we can always put you up. Now
would you care to swim? We have a bathing pond here.
It was made in the days of our glory, but, being made, it
is easy to keep up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She led the way through a gap in a rose-hedge to a terrace
of white marble, in the midst of which was a swimming
pool, full of clear water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There you are,” she said, “if ever you want a swim.
A plunge now would do us both good; but before we plunge,
shall we just walk back to the house, to see if Carlotta has
returned?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, certainly,” Hi said; “but I haven’t heard her
horses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor I,” she said. “But she ought to be back. She is
the swimmer amongst us. She does all things well, but
she swims like a sea-bird.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They found that Carlotta had not returned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She ought to be back by this time,” Rosa said. “But
in this country trains are sometimes late in starting, as
you will find. Let us walk to the gates, to see if she be
on the road.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They saw no one on the road, save three men with a handcart
who were coming slowly from the direction of the city
and pausing at intervals to paste handbills on walls and
palings. They paused to paste a bill upon a ruinous wall
opposite the Piranhas’ gate; Rosa and Hi watched them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bill-stickers,” Hi said. “I did not know that you had
them here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes,” Rosa said. “We are civilised here; bills,
drains and only one wife, just like Europe. But we keep
them for great occasions like bull-fights, these bills, I
mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bull-fights,” Hi said. “Do you still have them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the season for them; probably this is an
announcement of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d love to see a bull-fight; it must be frightfully
exciting. Do let us wait to see what it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bill-sticker, with a few deft thrusts of his brush, set
the poster in its place. It was a yellow poster, printed
in blunt black type with a tall red heading:</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>“Proclamation of the Government.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is only a pronunciamento,” Rosa said; “not bulls
after all. Can you read it from here? I cannot see anything
without my glasses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something about religion, as far as I can make it out,”
Hi said. “Dios is God, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what it is, then; all about religion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are rather a lot of Dioses,” Hi said after a pause;
“but then I suppose it’s Lent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Rosa said, a little snappily. “In my Church it
is the season for Dioses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donna Emilia met them on their way back through the
house to the pond. “Carlotta not yet back?” she said.
“She has probably driven to one of the stores. Come in,
then, to drink maté. Tea here is never good, Highworth;
we drink maté amargo, a bitter drink; not unlike your
camomile tea, they tell me; we think it refreshing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi did not find it refreshing, but drank one little silver
pipkin for the experience and a second for politeness.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch5'>V</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>“I</span>s</span> anyone coming here this afternoon?” Rosa
asked. “No one, so far as I can tell,” her mother
answered. “I am not asking people, because I
want you to see Carlotta while you can. Besides, it is
Lent; one should be quiet in Lent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are putting placards in the road,” Rosa said.
“We could not read them; but they seemed to be about
quiet at Easter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad,” Donna Emilia said. “The last exhibition
of disorder disgraced our country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old butler entered. “Señora,” he said, “Don
Inocencio desires to speak with you, if it be your pleasure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let him come in,” she answered. “Don Inocencio,
Highworth, is one of the Senators of the White party, to
which we belong. He was an old friend of my husband’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I not go?” Hi asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, stay, it’s very good for you,” Rosa said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Don Inocencio was a little pale man with a habit of
inflating his cheeks; when he did this, he looked more
important than at other times. He held a roll of paper in
his left hand; he had very nice manners and spoke in
English on finding Hi there. He was in a state of some
agitation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear lady,” he said, “I have come all this way, in
a great hurry, because of the importance of the occasion.
The man has been permitted and permitted till he has
presumed and presumed; but now he has outstepped all
bounds; he has, if I may say so, without inelegance, burst,
like the frog in the fable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who has burst without inelegance?” Rosa asked.
“Do tell us. Could he do it again, publicly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has done it publicly,” Don Inocencio said, “It
cannot be done twice in a civilised country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is this?” Donna Emilia asked. “I do not quite
understand? Has there been some accident?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought that at first,” Don Inocencio answered. “I
thought at first, this is not genuine; this is a ruse or trick,
designed by an enemy. It would be a skilled thrust, though
that of a devil, to lead people to suppose that this came
from our enemy. Then I thought, no, this thing is too
mad to be anything but genuine; no counterfeit would be
so crazy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what is it, Don Inocencio?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you not read the proclamation?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A proclamation; which; what proclamation?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is at present only one, which will be historical.
This is it, this scroll. They started to put this upon the
walls at the time of the siesta; it is now everywhere; can
it be that you have not seen it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; no, indeed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I am a bringer of news. When I read it, I
thought, this, if genuine, will be a landmark in our story.
I must have copies of this; so must Donna Emilia; therefore
I procured copies from the bill-stickers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know that I am a collector of documents, which
will go to my nephew; all things, especially documents,
if old enough, have romance; this will have much more
than romance, being the cause, if I am not much mistaken,
of great events in the near future. We live in stirring
times, Miss Rosa. You, Mr. Ridden, will see great events,
really great events, as the Blanco party reasserts its ideals.
Wait, now; for this big document; I will display my wares
upon this chair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pulled a chair towards him so that he could spread
the paper upon the back: it was a yellow paper, printed in
blunt, black type with a tall red heading:</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>“PROCLAMATION OF THE GOVERNMENT.”</p>

<p class='noindent'>He glanced at the faces of his audience for some expression,
which he did not find.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What,” he said, “no comment?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None,” Rosa said. “Mother and I cannot read well
without our glasses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I,” Hi said, “cannot read Spanish very fluently
yet. In fact, I can only get as far as ‘Government.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps, Inocencio,” Donna Emilia said, “you will
be so kind as to read it for us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly,” he said, “I will read it aloud: only I must
warn you, that its contents are not such as are usual, I will
not say in a proclamation, but in print of any kind. To
begin with, it is, I must warn you, from first to last a print of
the last blasphemy of madness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The listeners did not answer this, but looked and felt
uncomfortable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you not read, then?” Donna Emilia said at
last. Don Inocencio began to read aloud. He bent
a little over the paper, so that he might read; he beat
time with his left hand, in a pumping stroke, to mark his
cadence. He began as follows:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This,” he said, “is his preludium or exordium.</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>PROCLAMATION OF THE GOVERNMENT.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Forasmuch as I, Don Lopez de Meruel, King,
Emperor and Dictator of Santa Barbara, am convinced
of my divinity and of my oneness with God. Know
all men, that henceforth, throughout this my heaven
of Santa Barbara, I assume the style and name of
God, with the titles of Thrice Holy, Thrice Blessed,
Thrice Glorious.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you make of that?” he said, “for a
beginning?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The man is mad,” Rosa said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is blasphemy unspeakable,” Donna Emilia said.
“I tremble lest fire descend on us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is nothing to what follows,” Don Inocencio said.
“I will read on. The rest is incredibly much worse. But
the rest, I, for one, rejoice at. It continues thus:</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'>I therefore, thy God, decree, that henceforth my
mortals worship and sacrifice to me in all churches,
chapels and places of worship whatsoever; that all
prayer, praise, worship and adoration, with all hymns,
psalms and spiritual ejaculations of whatever kind, be
henceforth addressed to me, whether in public or in
private, I, thy God Lopez, decree it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Likewise thy God decrees (and in reading this, Donna
Emilia, I ask pardon of my Maker) thy God decrees,
that all other Gods, saints and suchlike, hitherto
worshipped in this my Heaven, such as (here he writes
in a way that cannot be quoted) shall be cast aside,
their images defaced, their altars denied and their
rituals omitted, upon pain of death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Furthermore, thy God decrees that my image be
placed in all churches and in all chapels of churches,
wheresoever there be an altar; and that instead of the
services hitherto used at such places, a service to me
only shall be used, with the title the Red Mass to God
Lopez, the Thrice Holy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And thy God decrees, that at the mention of thy
God, at His passing, at His coming, upon His feast
days, as at the passing of His priests and in the presence
of His decrees, all My people, without exception, shall
cry, Blessed be God Lopez, and shall sign the mark of
thy God, a circle and a dot, upon breast and head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lopez, Thrice Glorious, Thrice Blessed, Thrice Holy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All who infringe This My Decree, in Thought or
Word or Deed, shall suffer Death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From My Heaven in Plaza Verde,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>⊙ &nbsp;&nbsp;LOPEZ &nbsp;GOD &nbsp;LOPEZ. &nbsp;&nbsp;⊙</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“That,” Don Inocencio said, “is our ruler’s proclamation
in this year of grace. What do you think of it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosa went to the paper to read some printing at the foot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is genuine,” she said. “It is printed at the palace
press.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe it to be genuine,” Don Inocencio said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donna Emilia crossed herself for the third time: she
spoke with some difficulty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you say, Inocencio, that you rejoice at this proclamation?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do,” he said, “sincerely, Emilia, I do. We have
been for far too long apathetic: now this outrage will
rouse us from sleep: it may be our salvation as a nation.
We ourselves are in some measure responsible for this
madness. We have connived at madness in the palace
too long: he takes advantage of our supineness to seize
us by the throats. Now there can be but one answer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely,” Donna Emilia said, “a vengeance of Heaven
will fall upon a man like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our Caligula will not long survive his decree,” Don
Inocencio said. “Our old days of the Blancos will begin
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What will people do?” Hi asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They will do much,” Don Inocencio said. “For a
beginning, the priests are already leading their young
men to tear down these placards. In the New Town,
a priest known to me was gathering the fraternity of his
parish as I passed by on my way here. The week will see
Don Lopez out of his palace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder,” Rosa said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wonder what, dear?” her mother asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whether this follows on what Chacon told me half an
hour ago. The Hinestrosa creature escaped in some way.
The Reds must know by this time that the Whites are
planning something. This is their counter-stroke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us at least be thankful that General Chavez must
be in the city by this time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think he must be,” Don Inocencio said. “Perhaps it
is too early for General Chavez to be here, or indeed to be
already on his way, but preparing to be on his way,
that, yes, we might declare with confidence. Undoubtedly,
he is preparing to be on his way, to, how
shall we put it? to draw the sword of outraged religion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank God that we may think that,” Donna Emilia
said. “We know, that however indolent Luis may be,
he is great enough to overcome his indolence when his
country calls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think so, mother,” Rosa said. “I don’t think
he is. His country has called ever since the last election.
What has he done? He has been at home distilling
liqueurs and trying to grow Pommard grapes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why not?” Don Inocencio said. “Thus the
great Roman patriots were employed when their country
cried to them. They were on their farms, pruning their
vines, or ‘binding faggots,’ as I think Horace puts it,
‘at the bidding of a Sabine grandmother.’ But when their
country called, they arose; exchanging, as someone says,
the service of the rustic god, whose name I forget, for that
of Mars. Besides, Luis Chavez is a soldier. He needs
the opportunities of the soldier, attack or defence, rather
than those of the debater and intriguer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not think that he is a soldier any more than he is
a statesman,” Rosa said. “He is a self-indulgent, indolent
country gentleman, who loves his garden and his book.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have known Luis Chavez for a great many years,
Rosa,” her mother said. “You are not just to him. He
is a good man. If he be not hasty, it is because he is wise.
He weighs situations before he decides. He asks God’s
direction before he acts. I think that we ought all now to
pray that he may be directed to act wisely now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Before we do that, mother,” Rosa said, “we really
ought to send into the town for Carlotta. She has not yet
returned. There is a good deal of noise in the town;
listen to that. There may be rioting or shooting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me go,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought I heard the horses,” Donna Emilia said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are no horses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is a noise though,” Hi said. “There is shouting.
Someone is shouting and coming along the road.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosa was sitting beside Hi. She clutched his arm as
though she wished to crush it. He felt her tremble or
thrill like a taut guy suddenly stricken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hi,” she whispered, “is it rioters in the road, mobbing
her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no,” Hi said, “it sounds like a man crying news.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen,” Don Inocencio said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is only one voice,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it is only one voice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you town-criers here?” Hi asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a newspaper seller crying some special edition,”
Don Inocencio said. Pablo, the major domo appeared,
with maté for Don Inocencio.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pablo, is this shouter in the road a newspaper seller?”
Donna Emilia asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Señora. He announces some murder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cause Felipe to procure a copy of the paper for me,
will you, Pablo?” Don Inocencio asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will, Señor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Pablo had gone, Don Inocencio rose, with a
look of great importance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is quite clear to me,” he said. “Judgment has
overtaken the blasphemer already. Some deliverer has
stricken Lopez in the moment of his blasphemy. I knew
that our nation did but sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I trust that no such thing as that has happened,” Donna
Emilia said. “Of all the terrible things, to be flung
suddenly into death is the most terrible; and for one to die
in the very utterance of blasphemy is what no enemy could
wish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One cannot think of him as a blasphemer, mother,”
Rosa said, “but as a poor madman. And if some other poor
madman has mak’d him siccar, I don’t think one should
examine the ways of Providence too critically.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be like the slaying of the Philistine,” Don
Inocencio said. “Another David has arisen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Carlotta has not returned, mother,” Rosa said. “I
think Felipe ought to go to enquire what is happening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I go?” Hi asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She has Manuel with her,” Donna Emilia said. “It
may well be that the trains are stopped. In these crises
they often put embargo on the trains. Manuel will have
taken her to her brother’s at Medinas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, won’t you let me go, to make sure for you?”
Hi asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pablo entered with the newspaper, which he gave to Don
Inocencio. Hi noticed that Pablo looked much shaken
and that he said something in a very low voice as he
gave the paper. Plainly something terrible had happened.
Don Inocencio opened the paper, with a trembling pair
of hands; he looked suddenly deflated. Pablo left the room
softly closing the door. Don Inocencio turned very white,
sat down hurriedly and dropped the paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, Inocencio?” Emilia said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not Carlotta?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, no, no,” Inocencio said. “Chavez. General
Chavez has been murdered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My God. Luis? But how?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It tells little. ‘We grieve to announce the terrible
news, that General Luis Chavez was assassinated by a
ruffian, at the station of Aguas Dulces, at half-past two
this afternoon, while waiting for the train to Santa Barbara,
where he was expected to speak in Congress to-night. The
murderer has been arrested.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And where is Carlotta?” Rosa cried. “She is in the
city all this while. Is she, too, in the hands of the Red
murderers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God in Heaven forbid, child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are her horses,” Hi said. “That is the jingle
of their silver; they are almost at the door.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us come down, then, to meet her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They found her chaise and horses at the door: Carlotta
was not there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were you in time for the Meruel train?” Donna Emilia
asked the driver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Señora, in good time,” the man said. “Afterwards,
the train being gone, on hearing of rumours, the
Señorita drove to Medinas, whence she sends this letter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” Donna Emilia said. “You had better
stable your horses, then.” As the man drove to the stables.
Donna Emilia opened the letter, and dropped the envelope,
which Hi picked up (and kept). “She has gone to Miguel’s,”
Donna Emilia said. “Miguel is her brother, Highworth.
Miguel thinks she had better stay there for the present.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wisely decided,” Don Inocencio said. “And I will
now take my leave, since I must go to the Circle, to see
Hermengildo before the House to-night. Let me drive
you, Mr. Ridden, since I pass your hotel.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>While they waited in the drive for the caleche a party
of Pitubas, under a negro who wore a green feather in his
hat, rode up to them. He saluted Rosa, and presented
a warrant. Rosa read it, called Pablo, and gave him some
directions. Pablo led the troops to the stables, from which
they removed all the horses, including Carlotta’s team.
The Senator’s horse, being old, they left. When they had
secured these horses, they rode off with them to another
White house further down the bay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re taking the horses,” Rosa explained. “They
always begin by taking our horses. That’s the first danger
sign.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But good heaven,” Hi said. “Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Military reasons,’ they say in their warrant; but they
really mean, so that the Whites shall not communicate
with each other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you get them back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, probably not. You see, they’ve only gone to the
White house down the bay; not to those two Red houses.
This may make you understand our local politics a little.
It shows you Santa Barbara as she is. It isn’t the Paradise
it looks, is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s got angels in it,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hi,” she said, “I’m so anxious about her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is safe at her brother’s, surely?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She ought not to have gone there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why ever not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know, but she ought not. I knew it when I saw
the chaise had not brought her. She has done the wrong
thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will take a note to her if you like,” Hi said, “and
bring her back here, too, if she wishes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She won’t come back here,” Rosa said. “Nor could
she, after dark, with these patrols in the streets; but if you
will take a letter for me, I shall be grateful. The de Leyvas
live outside the West Gate, off the Anselmo Road, in a part
called Medinas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Medinas Close is where my old murderer lives,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are fearful rookeries close to the palace,” Rosa
said. “They are all owned by the de Leyvas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She wrote a letter, which she gave to Hi to take.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If she wants to send any message,” Hi said, “of course,
I will bring it back at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hi,” she said, “you really are a dear.” She caught
him by the neck and kissed his forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Somewhat rougey,” Hi thought, as he mopped his
brow, while he drove with Don Inocencio. “But an
awfully good-hearted sort, Rosa.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>The drive to the hotel was interesting; Hi had never
before seen a city in a state of excitement. The newsboys
were crying special editions; parties of men and boys
were marching to drums and fifes under Red banners;
certain shops, which did not display Red colours, were
having their windows broken. On the water-front a
guardia warned Don Inocencio and his driver that the
Martial Law was proclaimed, and that all carriages were to
be off the streets by eight o’clock. “Bad, bad,” Don
Inocencio muttered. “I know not which of us will escape
such nets.” He left Hi at his hotel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here Hi found two envelopes waiting for him. The first
contained a printed card from Roger Weycock, asking him
to attend a special meeting of the English in Santa Barbara,
at the Club, at seven o’clock that evening; the second
contained a similar card, with a few words written in pencil
by Allan Winter: “Don’t go to this. Keep clear of
politics here.—A. W.” The cards had been hurriedly
printed, probably as soon as the proclamation had appeared,
the ink on them was still moist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Winter was right,” Hi thought. “Weycock is in
with the Reds, trying to turn English opinion that way,
He’s organising this meeting for that end. But Winter’s
right; we ought to keep clear of politics here; I won’t go.
But all the same, I am jolly well a White in this business,
and I’ll help the Whites all I can. By George, I suppose
those devils, the Reds, could arrest me for carrying
letters.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun was setting when he drove off in a caleche for
the de Leyva house at Medinas. On his way, he saw scenes
between parties of Reds and Whites which made him wonder
at the strength of the feelings between them. “Killing
Chavez and claiming to be God did not rouse this,” he
thought. “This hate has been simmering for years; this
is only the boiling over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the West Gate, a Red patrol was stopping the traffic
for examination before permitting it to pass; its officer
turned back a carriage which had been trundling in front
of Hi for some minutes. He then came forward to question
Hi, found that he was English and allowed him to proceed.
He did this, as Hi thought, grudgingly, in a way which made
him wonder, whether the English were as much loved as
his father had always said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond the gate, the Anselmo road was a narrow street
from which narrow courts opened. Street and courts
swarmed with people, all talking at the tops of their voices,
but above all the talking the harsh bellow of public orators
in praise of violence sounded. The place stank of mice,
sweat, fried fish and damp washing. Hi called to the
driver: “Is this Medinas?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Medinas, si,” the driver said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little boys clambered on to the caleche, asking for
“Frencha penny. Ingles penny.” A fat, pale-faced
young man hopped on to the step and poised there while
he made his proposals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You want to see the sights?” he said. “I be your
guide. I show you very funny sights. I show you not
the usual sort of thing. You like a nice cock-fight, no?
You like a quail-fight, no? See now, I take you to a
special thing, not many knows about, a good dog-fight.
There now, only three dollar. Well, I take you to a special
thing to-night; something you never see, perhaps ever
again. No? Well, you go to dam prayer-meeting, see?
dam prayer-meeting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He swung off to seek for a client elsewhere. The caleche
passed from the narrows into a broader space, went under
an old archway of withering red and yellow plaster and came
out into an avenue of palms lit by electric light. Turning
from this through an ilex grove it stopped at the de Leyva
palace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi was admitted into a great cool hall built of white
Otorin marble. All round it and against its columns were
the stands of the de Leyva armour, some of which had
marched in the Conquest. Carlotta joined him almost at
once; he gave her the letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought that perhaps you would bring a letter,” she
said. “I suppose Rosa wants me to go back to her? My
brother is against that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope,” Hi said, “I do hope that Don Manuel will
not be attacked by these Reds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is far away by this time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi felt that he had said a tactless thing, even to
suggest that Don Manuel might be attacked, so he
added:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should pity the man who attacked Don Manuel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is nice of you to say that, Hi,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he see the proclamation, or hear of the murder,
before he started?” Hi asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Rosa tells me that his captive, the Hinestrosa,
has been rescued.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think of my country?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s produced you and Don Manuel and Donna Emilia,”
he said. “I think it’s a marvellous country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may be marvellous, if it turn now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will turn,” he said. “No nation will stand that
proclamation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If a nation be only mad enough, it will stand anything,”
she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope,” Hi said, “that Don Manuel will find his
mother better, when he gets there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fear that there is little hope of that,” she said. “A
telegram came here .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he can hardly see his mother
alive again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry to hear that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Others are not so sorry,” she said, in a strange voice.
He looked at her with a rush of understanding that she was
standing alone, through her love of Don Manuel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but they must be,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry?” she said. “Alas, they are thanking God
that my lover is out of the way at this time. You do not
know the Whites: how broken we are into cliques. My
brother, a great man in so many ways, dreads and hates
my lover: he thinks him too dangerous: he wants Bazan
to lead the party. If Manuel were here now, Bazan would
not stand for five minutes. Then, I suppose, my brother
would challenge Manuel to a duel. So, if I bring Manuel
back, I break with all I have loved in the past.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you will bring him back,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him in a way which he never forgot; but
she did not answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me go and bring him back for you,” Hi pleaded.
“Of course, I’m only a boy, but I’ll go like a shot. I’ll
take any message you like. Do let me. I’ll never be anything
again all my life, probably, except just a planter. But
just this once let me ride for you. I only saw you for the
first time this morning; but you don’t know what you are
to me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in my life, I mean .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you I mean, just there
being such a person. Of course, you’re sick of men saying
this to you. Miss de Leyva, will you let me go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Carlotta will not let you go,” she said, “I’m sure
Miss de Leyva won’t. But I cannot bring Manuel here,
against my brother’s prayers, even if I would, from his
mother’s death-bed. But there is one thing which I wish
you would do for me: take a note from me to Rosa.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, I’ll gladly take a note,” he said, “and bring
back an answer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There will be no answer. You will just have time to
leave the note and get back to your hotel before the streets
are cleared.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While she wrote the note, Hi thought of a suggestion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say,” he said. “Quite apart from calling Don
Manuel here, there is some point in letting him know the
news and telling him not to come. Couldn’t you let me
do that for you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re very determined, Hi,” she said. “But you
must stay in Santa Barbara and keep out of our
politics.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why? You will have to send someone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will not send you, Hi.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not? Have you anybody better?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There could not be anybody better, nor as good;
but this is not a thing I could let you attempt. Do you
know, that if the Reds were to find you doing this you
might be expelled the country, or even shot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For taking a message?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That counts as spying in time of war.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who would know that I was taking a message?
I should just be an English tourist. That settles it. I’ll
go off and get a horse and start at once and find him and
tell him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no,” she said. “It is impossible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I’m a boy and don’t know Spanish?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, indeed,” she said, “but because we want you
to settle here. Become a citizen later, if you wish, but,
until then, you must avoid our troubles. Now here is my
note to Rosa, if you will deliver it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was very dim in the hall away from the tapers on the
writing table. There were amphoræ full of sweet-smelling
shrubs. He could see her face and hands against the
darkness of the leaves: her head seemed crowned by white
flowers. She switched on some lights so that the hall
seemed suddenly full of armed men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you give me a sprig of those flowers?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Willingly.” She broke a spray for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the flower?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hermosita.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I ever see you again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. Come to-morrow to lunch: you must
meet my brother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, thank you. I’ll bring back an answer from
Rosa, if she sends one. Anything that I can ever do for
you will always be absolute happiness; you know that,
don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Hi.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave him her hand, in the foreign fashion, to kiss:
he was grateful for this. A clock chimed for half-past
seven. “You must go,” she said, “you haven’t much
time.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>His caleche jolted him back through Medinas, which was
now lit for the night from its many windows. He saw it as
a darting of children and a slinking of men, amid a noise of
babies squalling, men singing and women screaming. A
gas-lamp at a corner of a lane lit the words on a wooden
direction post, To Medinas Close; he could just see a lit
space surrounded by decaying old black houses, seven or
nine storeys high. “So that is where ’Zeke lives,” he
thought. “I’ll go to see the old man as I come back to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was delay in getting through the gates, in spite of
his pleading that he was English. He delivered his letter
to Rosa, learned that there was to be no answer, and then
drove off (his driver in a hurry) to reach the hotel before
eight o’clock. On coming to the gate on his way back,
he had some trouble with the guard. Unfortunately it was
not the guard which had passed him through ten minutes
before. The sergeant of this guard was a mulatto (with an
Irish accent), who was very rude and smelt of aniseed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You damned English,” he said. “What’s stopping ye
staying in your homes? I suppose ye’re ate up by your
lice, and think ye can scrape them off on us. Well, get
through and be damned to ye and obey the proclamation
another time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hotel people opened their doors grudgingly to him.
They gave him a tasteless supper in the ill-lit, frowsy dining-room,
from which all the life had gone; everybody seemed
to have gone to bed. He hurried through the meal and
then went up to his bedroom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here, in bed, he went over the events of the day with
a great deal of relish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have had a day,” he thought. “I have never enjoyed
a day so much. She is beautiful, she is marvellous, and
to-morrow I shall see her again. Oh, my God, she is
beautiful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He kept repeating this as he thought of her image with
praise and blessing: he could not sleep at first because of
her. At a little before midnight some rifles were fired in
the streets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By George, rifles,” he thought. “I say, this is the
heart of life.” The firing, whatever it was, stopped after
a couple of minutes. In the quiet which followed, perhaps
not long after twelve, he fell asleep.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch6'>VI</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>W</span>hen</span> he had slept for nearly a watch, he was
wakened by a ticking as though the wind were
shaking a slat in a Venetian blind. As the noise
continued, he sat up, thinking, “Here is the breeze. I’ll
have to shut my window.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He realised, then, that the noise was from the door. It
was a little light ticking noise, not unlike the gnawing of
a mouse, except that it never varied nor grated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s only a death-watch,” he said. “No, it’s the
breeze, rattling the door. I’ll jam it up with a piece of
paper.” He turned out of bed and groped in the dark for
the cover of his paper-backed novel. “I’ll wedge it up
with this,” he thought. He tore off the cover and folded
it into a wedge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By George,” he thought, suddenly, with a leaping
heart. “It isn’t the door rattling, it’s somebody knocking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was no doubt somebody knocking, but with a special
secret midnight knock which might awaken him but alarm
no other person on the corridor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By George,” he thought, “somebody’s tapping with
finger-nails. This is romance, by George. I’ll have to be
jolly careful now, or very likely I’ll have my throat cut.
Who can be knocking?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could not think who would be knocking, but he
did not for one moment think that it was a woman come
for love of him. He was not frightened. The knocking
was of a piece with the romance of the day before. It gave
him a thrill of delight to think that the knocker might be in
peril and the knock a warning to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?” he thought. “I’m a foreigner here, as
well as a heretic. Why shouldn’t there be a sort of
Bartholomew massacre beginning?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He crept to the door. The key was in the keyhole; he
could see nothing there but darkness. By the fanlight, he
could tell that the corridor beyond was almost pitch dark.
The knocker paused, as though he had heard the creak of
his approach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is there?” Hi whispered. “Who is there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To his amazement, Rosa answered him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is I, Rosa. Rosa Piranha. Open, Hi; open quick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He opened the door swiftly yet silently; Rosa
glided in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s only me, Hi,” she whispered. “I thought I’d
never make you hear. Lock the door, lock it, but don’t
make a sound. Oh, my God, my God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll strike a light,” he said. “Whatever is the matter?
I’ll have a light in a minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No light,” she said. “Don’t strike a light. We might
be seen from outside.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must get you a light,” he whispered, “or you’ll be
falling over things, and rousing the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He struck a match: he had a glimpse of Rosa dressed
as a peon with a sombrero jammed over her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll sit on the bed,” she whispered. “Put the match
out, Hi.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put out the match; she sat on the bed and began to
shudder till the bed quaked. As he did not know what
to do, he did nothing. He stood well away from Rosa,
waiting for her to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good old Rosa,” he said at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, good old Rosa,” she said with a giggle; then she
trembled until she began to sob.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good Lord, Rosa,” he said, “pull yourself together.
Good Lord, what is it? What has happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those devils, Hi. They’ve got Carlotta.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What devils? The Pitubas?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. At least, I don’t know if they were Pitubas.
Anyhow the Reds have got her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I saw her after seven o’clock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They arrested her at ten. They got her brother, too.
They’re rounding up all the Whites. A peon of the de
Leyvas came to us to tell us. They shot at him, but he got
away. Hi, they’ve put her into prison. The Reds have
put Carlotta into prison.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good Lord. But, hang it, Rosa, they’ve got no case
against her. They’ll certainly let her out in the morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Lopez has gone mad, Hi. We don’t know what is
happening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. good Lord. It’s four o’clock in the morning;
more. How on earth did you get in? Look here, is there
anything that I can do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve got her in their prison on a charge of resisting
authority, or being deemed to be the associate of those
planning to resist authority. The peon heard her deny the
first charge. The officer said that he should arrest her on
the other. And they may shoot her, Hi.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shoot Carlotta? Never.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They may.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, hang it, Rosa.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This isn’t England, Hi, but a place where we hate; you
don’t know how we hate. Mother cannot stand these
shocks, but I had to wake her and tell her. She said at
once, ‘We must get word through to Manuel.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here she stopped at a horrible memory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go ahead,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This isn’t like England, Hi,” she said. “Twice, even
in my life-time, Whites and Reds have made it dangerous
for each other. So we make arrangements and codes for
messages. We had one of our boys, Estevan Osmeña,
sworn to take a message in case of need. We roused him
up. Our horses were gone, as you saw; the horses are
always the first thing they take, but we sent him off to
where he could get a horse. I thought nobody saw
him go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here she stopped to tremble till the bed seemed to giggle
at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on,” Hi said, “cheer up and go on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About two hours ago,” she said, “when we had all gone
back to bed, a patrol rode up to the house and summoned
mother to open the door. I said that she was too ill, but
that I would open. So I lit up and opened. There was the
mulatto, Zarzas, with some Pitubas. He said, ‘This is for
you.’ He gave me Estevan’s hand, cut off at the wrist,
with mother’s letter pinned to it. He said, ‘This is the
Dead Letter Post; the White letter comes back Red.
I would recommend you send no more.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I had to serve him and his men with drinks, of
course; he called it ‘postage for midnight delivery.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then they had killed your groom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say,” Hi said. “But hold on a minute, I’ll just
dress, if you’ll excuse me. But tell me, how did you pass
the patrols and the gates?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Market people can always pass in the early mornings.
I brought in a basket of flowers like a gardener’s peon.
You remember Manuel said at lunch that there was a way
into this hotel at the back. I came in by that. I knew
your floor and room. But I nearly died of terror when I
heard the negroes at their gambling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t wonder. But I say you have got some pluck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Hi, forgive me,” she said, “but you’re the only
person I can think of. Will you take the news to Manuel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, of course I will, Rosa. I wanted to last night
but Carlotta wouldn’t let me. I’ll go like a shot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She fell upon her knees and kissed his hands, calling upon
God and the saints to bless him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right, Rosa,” he said. “That’s all right.
We’ll save her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This devil, Lopez, is going to wipe out the Whites,”
she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not he,” Hi said. “Don’t you think it, Rosa.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is to stop him? We’re all in his power.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not you,” Hi said. “He’s done something wicked
and stupid, which won’t prosper; you’ll see it won’t. Now
about getting to Manuel. I don’t know a word of Spanish,
except Dios and si and the oaths those sailors told me.
Where can I get a horse, to begin with? I suppose all the
livery stables will be closed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll get no horse here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even though I’m English?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. This city is isolated. No trains, no horses.
You’ll have to walk to a place called Anselmo, about fifteen
miles from here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean, out past the de Leyvas’ place? That
Anselmo?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. There are two White brothers there, the Elenas,
George and William, horse-breeders. They will give you
horses and put you in the way to get relays further west.
There are two ways of getting to Anselmo; one, by the
road, past the de Leyvas’ place, which you’d have to walk;
the other is, to take a boat down the bay, nine or ten miles,
to the place La Boca, where you could probably hire a
horse or trap and ride or drive there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How would I take a boat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At the pier there are scores of market-boats. Ask for
Pedro Ruiz and ask him to take you to La Boca. If Pedro
isn’t there, dozens of others will be; they’re mostly
Italians.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll make them understand,” Hi said. “Will they let
me down the pier?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, if you aren’t stopped beforehand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The boat way seems the quicker,” he said. “I’ll try
the boat way. But look here, Rosa, they’ll surely watch
the boats for people trying to get away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They may, but that and the road are the only ways to
Anselmo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we’d better try both. Why not send my old
English murderer from Medinas? He’d go like a shot and
you could trust him absolutely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is an idea, Hi. I suppose he can ride?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was a stable-lad in his youth. He was even a
jockey once, of sorts, I think they said, but he was warned
off for something or other. I know he sounds awful; so
he is, as well as a little mad, but I know that you could
trust him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You say that he is mad? Could he remember a
message?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All he’ll have to remember is, ‘Reds have seized Carlotta:
come at once’; that and the address, ‘Don Manuel,
Encinitas.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll have to know more than that,” Hi said. “He’ll
have to get the horses out of these Elena people, at
Anselmo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our code word, <span class='it'>Dorothea</span>, will do that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And suppose the Elenas aren’t there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“George or William must be there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right, then; between us we’ll fix it. I say, this is
exciting. You are a brick to come to me for this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you knew what I think of you for taking it as you
do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose,” Hi said, “I suppose there’s no means of
telegraphing from Anselmo to Don Manuel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None. We’ve no telegraphs here, except along the
railways, and no railway at all across the central provinces.
You’ll have to ride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No means of telegraphing to anyone, in code, or something
of that sort? It would save so much time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The telegraphs are all under censorship, no message
would be sent. There’s no telegraph within seventy
miles of Encinitas, anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’ll be a long ride,” Hi said. “I wish I were more in
trim for a long ride. It will take three days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Hi.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I might do it in two, with luck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, if you only can,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now how about you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m blest if you will be. I’ll see you home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Hi; no.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, Hi. I shan’t be stopped with my market
basket and in this dress. And by the Farola there is a
short cut through the waste to our garden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll see you there, then. I must. I’ve got to ask you
scores of things which I must know. When you’re reasonably
safe, I’ll get to Medinas, see my murderer off, and
then come back to the pier and yell for Pedro Ruiz.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please God, the boats will be late this morning,” she
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If they come early, they go early; there may be no
boat for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Golly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a lot to say ‘Golly’ about in this Republic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s more in it than meets the eye,” he said. “I
suppose you’ve got no map of this city?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can I get to Medinas from the pier without going back
through the city?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, easily. There’s a road from the Farola to Medinas,
on the line of the old city ditch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, then; that’s a weight off my chest. Our
main task is to get out of this hotel to the pier: if we can
do that, we shall be fairly clear. Will there be patrols on
the roads outside the walls, or people on the watch at La
Boca and Anselmo?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Probably.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” he said, to cheer her. “We’ll fix them. I
suppose the Elenas will know some English?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much; but if you say <span class='it'>Dorothea</span> to them, they’ll
make your next course clear, even if they have to send a
guide with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good. I think I’ve got it all pretty straight. All
right. I’m ready. We’ll start, then. Oh, but wait one
minute. I must get something out of my trunk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some hours before, when he had returned from Carlotta,
he had pressed her spray of hermosita between two sheets of
the hotel blotting-paper, which he had then laid away in
the trunk. He now opened this precious packet, broke off
a leaf from the spray, and placed it in his pocket-book;
the rest he put back into the trunk. He then wrote a few
words to the hotel proprietor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m ready now,” he said. “I’ll leave this note to say
that I’m coming back, and want my room kept.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Hi,” she said, “I’ve brought no money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have got money enough,” Hi said, “but I have not
got a revolver. Father wouldn’t let me take one. I knew
he knew nothing about it. Now we had better have a
story in case we’re stopped. We had better say that your
mother wanted me and that you had come to fetch me.
They couldn’t object to that. Where is your market
basket? In the cellar?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, in the hall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We had better go out by the hall,” he said. “And I
had better take no baggage. Then they would ask no
questions. If I were caught going out with a bag, they
would think I was shooting the moon. I have got some
handkerchiefs. That’s enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What will they think of my market basket?” she said.
“They will think I have come to steal the linen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leave it here,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I must have it to pass the gates.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you can show that it’s empty,” he said. “We
must chance it. Come on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They crept out into the deserted corridor, where all was
silent save for a snorer in one of the near-by rooms. They
crept to the stairs. All seemed silent on the landing below.
On the next floor they heard a child wake up with a
whimper. The coarse voice of a nurse from one of the
French-speaking islands called “Chocolat” to quiet it.
As this failed she made a testy reproof and turned grunting
out of bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All seemed silent on the floor below. Rosa touched
Hi’s arm at the stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a night porter asleep there,” she said, “on
that sofa on the landing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s sound asleep,” Hi said. “Come on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the third step from the bottom the porter had left
a small tray with glasses and a soda-water bottle. Hi trod
upon this, so that both he and it fell. The glasses broke,
the soda-water bottle rolled on to the broad uncarpeted
steps which led to the ground floor. It fell on to the first
step, then on to the second, then on, step by step, making
a noise like “Keblonk, Keblonk” at each step. Hi sat
on the mat at the stair-foot in fits of laughter. Rosa
stood beside him, giggling hysterically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hark at the beastly thing going ‘Keblonk,’ ” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a little tinkle the bottle rolled itself still. The
porter on the sofa sneezed suddenly and sat up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, for de Lord,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For de Lord,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He and Rosa clutched each other, shaking with laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you lovely angels, keep away the flies,” said the
porter and settled himself to sleep again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come along,” Hi whispered. “He’s asleep. We must
slide down the banisters of this flight. Don’t kick old
Keblonk as you pass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All was dark on the ground floor, but far away some
servant was already sweeping. This was the only sound
save the occasional crackle in the wicker chairs, as though
some ghost had sat down or arisen. In front of them was
the main entrance of the hotel, a glass barrier, broad steps
with deserted offices at each side, then the front doors. A
light was burning in the office to the left. Hi stole forward
upon tip-toe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The night porter’s asleep in the office,” he whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stole through the glass doors and tried the front
doors, which were locked and the key not there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The key’s gone,” he whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s in the office, I expect,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked, but could not see it on the key hooks nor on
the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must be somewhere here,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expect he’s got it in his pocket,” he whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There came a little flop upon the floor. Rosa had
knocked off a time-table from the edge of the table. The
man stirred in his sleep but did not wake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If he’s got it in his trouser pocket,” Hi whispered, “or
even in his side pocket, we’re done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Hi,” she whispered, “come on down the back
way through the cellar. Besides, I have got to get my
flower basket.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, dash, I had forgotten the flower basket.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hi,” Rosa said, “there’s someone coming.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They edged out into the hall as some of the hall lights
went up. A woman with a broom came along the corridor.
She took a good look at them, and Hi said, “It’s all right,
thanks. I’m English.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She seemed to think that it was not quite all right. She
made a gesture to show Hi that he could rouse the porter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Si, si,” Hi said, “but it’s absolutely all right, thanks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you looking for the key?” she asked in English.
“The key is here on this palm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She unhooked a key from one of the stubs of the palm
tree, fitted it to the lock and opened the door. She gave
a searching glance at Rosa. She closed the door behind
them on the instant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The breeze was coming in from the sea bitterly cold.
They looked up and down the deserted street. They saw
no sign of life except a cat on the other side of the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on,” Hi said, “down to the water-front.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the darkness of the cross roads a mounted policeman,
drawn into the shadows, watched them approach without
making a sign. When they were within a few yards of
him he put his horse suddenly across their path.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all right. I’m English,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man seemed to have orders not to molest foreigners.
He drew his horse back and jerked with his hand for them
to pass. Perhaps it was a guilty conscience which made
them think that he stared hard at Rosa. Anyhow he let
them pass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the water-front the tide of life had begun to flow to
the quays. Men and women were going to work that had
to be done, whatever rebellion came. They saw the
bright light at the pier end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s there,” Rosa whispered, “that the market-boats
come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two men who were slouching in front of them paused to
light cigarettes. They watched Hi and Rosa as they
passed and made remarks evidently very offensive, which
made Rosa catch her breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on. Don’t stop,” Rosa whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Colour was all over the eastern heaven and touching the
upper roofs and spires.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hi,” Rosa said, when they had gone a little distance,
“we shall never be able to do it. I am seen to be
a woman and there is a patrol in the streets stopping
people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There in front.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>About a hundred yards in front of them there was an
interruption in the flow of people. They could see the
gleam of helmets beyond the blackness of the crowd, which
grew greater as men and women flocked up to it. Plainly
the police or troops were examining all who were going
that way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hi,” Rosa said, “I can’t face the police in this dress.
It’s very silly, but I shall faint.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold up,” Hi said. “It will be perfectly all right.
We will get down to that barge on the beach there and you
can pin your cloak round you for a skirt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within a stone’s throw from the water-front was a green
barge, which Hi had noticed on the day of his landing. She
was lying on her bilge with the butts of her timbers sticking
out like bones. In the shelter of this wreck Rosa pinned
her cloak as a skirt and made her hat look less manly. After
this they marched into the crowd, which closed up behind
them as others arrived. It was a silent crowd of men and
women not fully awake. One or two voices asked, “What
are they stopping us for?” Some said, “Dogana,” or
“Search of suspects,” or “Search of the accursed Whites,
the murderers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The light grew upon the faces at each instant, the crowd
gathered and the delay continued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are they stopping us for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Close up, brothers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who are you shoving?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not me that’s shoving.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This way for the harem. Get your money ready.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The whistle will be gone. We shall be fined half a
peseta.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are they stopping us for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one could answer that question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi could make out that several times a minute one or two
people in front were allowed to pass on. At every such
passing the crowd surged forward till they were all jammed
up together, feeling breathless and inclined to faint. They
could hear a kind of catechism going on at the barrier, voices
bullying and voices submissive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why can’t they let us pass? What are they asking?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crowd was not to know why they were stopped.
After they had annoyed some hundreds of people with it,
the police suddenly removed the barrier and told the people
that they might get along out of it. The crowd slowly
surged forward among growls of “Keeping us waiting all
this time and in the end they didn’t want us. Now we
shall be fined a peseta for being late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They passed through the city gates, to the open space
where the market folk had cheered the Piranhas the day
before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is the pier, Hi,” Rosa said. “I can get home
through that waste piece, the old graveyard. You go up
that gully to the right, to Medinas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. Good luck. I’ll fetch Manuel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God bless you, Hi.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You, too. My love to your mother. And good luck.
And cheer up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She nodded, not having more words; she turned out of
the stream of workers into the old graveyard of the town
and did not look back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Hi set off for Medinas, he looked back several times
after her, till she had disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s got some pluck,” he thought. “I don’t think
she’ll be stopped now, going that way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His own way led through a road which having once been
the city ditch, was still a city dump and refuse pit under the
walls. On the left hand of the refuse were shacks and sties
of wood, for pigs, cows, horses and fowls; though men
lived in them, too. The road was an unpaven track in a
kind of gulley between the dump and the sheds. It was in
a mucky state at that time from the recent rains and the
habits of the market people. It stank, it was littered with
tins and stalks, rats were rummaging among the garbage,
and pariah dogs with the mange were scraping against the
sides of the sties. However, no men were abroad in it nor
any sign of a patrol. In about twelve minutes he was in
Medinas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some minutes he had noticed a glow upon the city
buildings, which he had thought to be the dawn. He now
found that it came from the red-hot shell of what had been
the de Leyva palace, which had been burnt since midnight.
A good many Medinas people were grubbing in the embers
for what they could find. Others were carrying away what
they had already found. A heap of things of all sorts,
armour, pictures, marbles, bronzes, furniture, porcelain,
curtains, clothes, cushions, musical instruments, antiques,
books, and portfolios, which had been looted before the fire
took hold, were being sold to all comers by a ruffian with a
big voice, who bellowed aloud his bargains, joked, tossed
the money received to a guard of Reds, and often gave
away what he could not readily sell. He was in the act of
selling a bronze female torso when Hi came up. Hi
noticed among the crowd the broad-faced picture-dealer
who had been rude two days before on the water-front.
This man winked at the auctioneer that the bronze should
be set aside for him. The auctioneer stopped his obscene
remarks and laid it aside.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>Medinas Close looked marvellous in that light of nearly
dawn, helped out by dying lamps. Its well of tall, mean,
narrow tenements, built on a slope, about a triangle of
grassless earth, needed some murderous half-light to give
it its quality. At the entrance to the Close an imbecile
woman, with the face of a corpse, held her hand for alms.
At the entrance of No. 41, black as the mouth of a cave, two
little boys, who talked through their noses as though their
throats were rotted away, were sharing what they had
stolen from the burning. Most of the Medinas tenants had
been picking plums from that same snapdragon. In the
well of the Close were some chairs and other furniture which
had been pitched down and smashed, because they would
not readily go through the narrow doors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the third floor,” Hi said to himself, “the middle
room of the three, if I don’t have my throat cut on the
way.” He went into that black cave, which stank of rat
and mouse; he struck himself a light so that he might see the
stairs, and came at once on a woman and a man clasped at
the stair-foot. He saw the woman’s eyes, like the eyes in
a skull. The man detached himself from her; he stank of
wine, she of musk. “You like to see my sister?” he said,
thickly to Hi.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three pesetas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two pesetas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You like to buy a nice watch, very cheap, very good?”
The woman, who had caught some glimpse of Hi, said
something in a low voice, which made the man stand aside
to let Hi pass to the next floor, where a man was beating
his wife in the intervals of a sermon. The morning light
gleamed a little on to this landing from a room which had
no door. Up above was the third floor, much darker,
being lit only with a taper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some weeks before this a man had been murdered at
the head of the stairs there. The dwellers of 41, having
scruples about the murder, had placed upon the wall a
coloured print of the Virgin, to whom they lit a taper each
night. This taper now showed Hi the three doors of the
landing; he knocked gently on the middle door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After knocking a second time, he was aware of a tenseness
in the room within, though no one answered. At a third
knock, he felt, rather than heard, other doors in the tenement
softly opened, while unseen eyes took stock of him.
Someone inside the room was moving something: “putting
something under the bed,” he thought. A board dropped
with a clatter, then a chair (so it seemed) was jammed
against the door from within, then a woman’s cautious
voice asked, “Who is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Señor Rust,” Hi said, in a low voice, “Señor Rust.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not let him in. He heard her moving about
inside, with queer little clicking noises as though she were
snapping on some pairs of stays (which indeed she was).</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Señor Rust,” he repeated, “Señor Rust.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lamp in the room, which had been turned down,
now turned up; the door opened a little; a short, sharp,
elderly dwarf of a woman stared at him, and motioned him
to come in. He went into a hot little lamp-lit room, where
’Zeke stood stock still, fumbling with his hat, beside the
bed. The woman bolted the door carefully behind him. She
had a skin like parchment, coloured like old ivory. She
looked at him out of sharp, black, beady eyes which missed
nothing. Her head trembled a little; her long green ear-rings
waggled and clicked. She looked like a gimlet about
to pierce. Hi knew, without any telling, that he had come
at a ticklish time, when the two were appraising loot from
the burning. His knock had been mistaken for the knock
of the police. Something had been stuffed under the floor
and a mat drawn over the place: ’Zeke was now standing on
the mat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman asked him in Spanish about his health,
adding that for her own part she asked nothing better from
God, since she was ever better after the rains, which, as it
was well known, drew away from the air we breathe many
most pestilential vapours. Hi replied in English that he
was afraid that he came at a very inconvenient time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rust,” he said, “could you take a message for me, and
be away, perhaps, for some days?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Master Highworth,” ’Zeke said, “I daresay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Starting at once?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where would it be to, Master Highworth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could we speak out of doors somewhere?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a bit unsettled out of doors, sir. We could slip
into the church for a bit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us go there, then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>’Zeke said something with gestures to Isabella, who
seemed suspicious and not well pleased. She questioned
’Zeke several times before she let them out. She then
followed him to the stair-head with questions, which ’Zeke
put from him with gestures and ejaculations. She was not
satisfied with these replies, because she went back to the
room, growling. Glancing upwards as he entered the Close,
Hi saw her head and shoulders craned from the window to
see where they were going.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the almost complete darkness of the church, Hi told
’Zeke what was wanted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I been to ’Carnacion,” he said. “It was there I went
with my bull, where the rabbits were. It was this Don
Manuel owned my bull; only I didn’t go so much by land,
as by sea, to Port ’Toche. I know the way to Anselmo;
it’s by the Foxes Inn. And I know the Mr. Elenas at
Anselmo, Mr. George and Mr. William, only they don’t
pronounce it like that. They breed horses, the Mr. Elenas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did a job of work for the Misters Elenas one time.
You see, Mr. Highworth, they got a stallion one time;
my word, he were a horse, only he wasn’t what we would
call a stallion, you understand, being for draught. Not
a shire horse, neither, but one of they French sort, really.
‘Whicker,’ he went, and ‘Whicker,’ he went, oh, it was a
treat to hear him: down he would go and up he come;
and all in play, really: only he hate his grooms, Mr. Highworth,
one after the other. It was all in play, really, only
they didn’t understand him, that was what it was, really.
You know he couldn’t abide velvet, this velvet stuff the
grooms wear. You’ve heard of the red rag to a bull? Well,
it was the same with him, only velvet. That was all it was.
When I showed ’em, they left off this velvet, then he didn’t
eat them, except, maybe, now and then a pinch and that.
And is that all I’m to say to the Misters Elenas and to Mr.
Manuel, just <span class='it'>Dorothea</span>, and he’s to come at once?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that’s all. How soon could you reach Anselmo?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three hours and that. But I’ll get a horse out along
the road, maybe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a long way to Encarnacion,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like a bit of sport, when I get a horse like these country
ones that’s got meat on the ribs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll hurry all you can, won’t you? People’s lives
depend on it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dammy, Mr. Highworth, I’ll go like your old grandfather,
and like what the old gentleman, old Mr. Ridden
done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose it’s all right, Master Highworth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it’s all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These foreigners aren’t like us, most of the time.
They got this devil-worship and all sorts. Now a man
likes to know what’s what and that. That’s only fair.
But it’s these yellow devils makes them not go above board.
They brought in the yellows to rule the whites; it’s that
causes all the trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the cause of the trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ll do my best, Mr. Highworth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you. I can’t thank you enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing I like better, really, than a bit of sport. I
was having difficulty, if you understand me, Master Highworth;
but then first I met you and now comes this other
job. I never had so much luck at one time before, except
that once at the races; and then I was cheated of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi gave him some money for expenses, thanked him and
urged him to go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not by the door we came in by, Mr. Highworth,” he
said. “That would never do. Them that see you go in
may watch for you out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were near the High Altar as he spoke. The door
by which they had entered the church was opened: someone
crept into the church. Hi saw the snub-nosed profile
of Isabella motionless for an instant, while she sought in
the darkness for her prey. ’Zeke on the instant plucked him
through a curtain to a swing-door and thence to a lane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We dodge the Close this way,” he said, “and I’ll be
back in a week or a bit better. And that will be all right,
Mr. Highworth; and I thank you, sir, I’m sure, very
kindly. And I wish you a happy Christmas, sir, though
I know it’s a long time to wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He set off as he finished speaking, in the shambling
run with much bending of the leg which old Bill Ridden
called “the poachers’ trot.” Hi had often seen old men
of the ’Zeke kind running in that way on winter mornings
when the hounds moved off to covert. He himself set off
at once by the old city ditch to the pier: it was almost
full morning. He wondered whether there would be any
boat for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He also wondered, with some misgivings, about poor old
Ezekiel. The phrase, “He never had so much luck at
one time before,” smote him to the heart. It might not
be much luck; it might be deadly; it certainly would
be dangerous, to go off on this errand when the Reds were
out. “I’ve taken him from his wife, too,” he thought.
“However, she’s no chicken.” As he went on, he wondered
whether Isabella might not have seen, chased and caught
her husband: in which case the message would not go.
Or suppose the Foxes Inn proved too much for him? “I
must chance all that,” he thought. “He’s as likely to get
through as I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thinking these things, he came out of the ditch into the
colour and life of the racing of the carts to market from the
Farola, with fish and fruit. These carts were light, open
lorries, each drawn by two horses, driven by natives, who
stood bare-armed, cloaked with coloured serapes, singeing
their lips with the sucked stubs of cigarettes across which
they cursed their horses. The workers scattered from
before them as they raced. The horses’ hooves struck
fire, the drivers leaned on the reins, beat with their sticks,
and screamed:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ar-re. Ar-re, sons of malediction.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Accursed be thy fool mare of a mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dog of a Pablo, give room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, ay, ay, we bring fish into the city.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the carts swayed into each other yet did not touch.
They swerved together as the road narrowed for the gate
and so disappeared. Hi turned from the open plaza on
to the pier. It was then a few minutes after six o’clock.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch7'>VII</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>O</span>n</span> the pier, Hi found a scene of confusion and
shouting, men and boys staggering with boxes and
baskets to carts; women urging them to hurry,
or screaming at their children, or cursing at the mules and
horses: carts were being backed and baskets dropped:
everybody was violent and abusive, not from ill-temper
but excitement, for this race to market was the event of
the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi thrust into the midst of the crowd, treading on a litter
of leaves, upon which the beasts had browsed. All that
part of the pier was heaped with things for the market,
bundles of living fowls tied five and five by the legs, baskets
of pigeons, geese from the sea marsh, musk melons, water
melons, pumpkins, gourds and vegetables of every sort and
shape, oranges, limes, bananas in crates and gaily painted
earthenware jars packed in the paper-like streamers of
corn sheathes. Hi came upon an Englishman, who was
superintending the lading of some big red clay jars into a
lorry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where shall I find the fish boats?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At the upper end of the pier,” the man said. “That’s
where they auction the fish. You may find the fish boats
gone by this, though.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the end of the pier was a wooden building, above
which was a pharos or pier light, which made a big, rosy
star against the dawn. Underneath this light the fish
market was being held. Hi heard a jabber and chatter
of bargaining.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look you, I will tell you what I will do. I will do it
for you, because I like you. I would not do it for anyone
else on earth, may St. James be my witness. I will give
you 3.75 the tierce.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By God, I had rather fling them back into the sea. By
God, I will fling them back into the sea. Here go some
back into the sea. The rest shall follow. 4.30 the tierce or
back they go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now look here, I will tell you what I will do. I will
do it for you because I like you. I wouldn’t do it for
anyone else on earth,” etc., etc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beside the bidders lay heaps of fish, many of them still
gasping. Small, black, slimy things, which looked like
pickles, crawled over their bodies. The fish lay in heaps
of shining paleness with odd jags of fins and prickles,
vacuous eyes, and mouths which bulged out and then
collapsed in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi stopped a fisherman with the question:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you Pedro Ruiz?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you Pedro Ruiz?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who knows?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pedro Ruiz?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ruiz?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Pedro Ruiz?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not know,” the man answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pedro Ruiz of La Boca?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of La Boca.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ayla Poca?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Si.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not know Ayla Poca.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; not Ayla Poca,” Hi explained, “but of La Boca.
Of, that is, de, La Boca, a place, a sort of a ciudad, sabe?
in the bay par la; La Boca.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not know at all,” the man answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does the Englishman want?” another man
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pedro Ruiz of La Boca,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ayla Poca?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not Ayla Poca. Of La Boca. De la Boca.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Boca?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Si.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“La Boca?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, La Boca?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes. La Boca.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The poblacion beside the bay, La Boca?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that is it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, La Boca. Hear you, Enrique, the gentleman
wants La Boca.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, La Boca. Ah, yes, indeed. Truly, it is that. Oh,
yes, La Boca,” Enrique repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is there, La Boca,” the man said, pointing south
along the bay. “La Boca is there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want Pedro Ruiz of La Boca.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pedro Ruiz.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pedro?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Si. Yes. Pedro Ruiz,” Hi said. “R-u-i-z.” The
men looked at him in bewilderment yet with courtesy.
They smiled and shook their heads. Hi thanked them
and turned from them. He did not much relish shouting
aloud in that crowd of foreigners; but he shouted:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pedro Ruiz. Pedro Ruiz.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A couple of lads mimicked his method with some success.
He repeated his cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, ha,” Enrique said to him full of pride. “You
want Pedro Ruiz?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, si.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, yes, indeed, Pedro Ruiz.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he here?” Hi asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Enrique said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Enrique began a long harangue in Spanish, of which Hi
understood not one word. Hi could not make out from the
gestures whether Pedro Ruiz had been disembowelled or had
been drinking soda water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See you,” he said, “can I get a boat to La Boca? A
boat to La Boca by the sea?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made signs of going by boat in the direction of La
Boca. Three other men had gathered about them to give
counsel. Some of them suggested Giordano.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi turned to these men and asked, “Is Pedro Ruiz here?
Pedro Ruiz?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They did not understand what he meant. They repeated
the syllables. All were courteous and eager to help,
but they were puzzled by the words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Enrique asked, “You want go La Boca?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes please, si,” Hi answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Giordano,” the men repeated. “Giordano.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi had a suspicion that “Giordano” meant to-morrow.
There was, he knew, some foreign word like “Giordano”
which meant either yesterday or to-morrow. It was
“oggi” or “aujourd’hui” or some other word with “jour”
in it. What would he do if there were to be no boat till
to-morrow?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This way Giordano,” Enrique said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He led him to the end of the pier. Some birds were
wheeling about the rosy light. From time to time they
swerved down with exquisite white grace, which glowed
into rose colour in the beam of the lamp, to snatch some
fish from the pile. Enrique looked over the rail at the
edge of the pier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Giordano,” he called.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Si,” a voice answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Enrique explained that here was a gentleman eager to
go to La Boca; he displayed Hi. Giordano was a very
tall, thin, melancholy man, dark and distinguished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you take me to La Boca, please?” Hi asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“La Boca? Si.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is so,” Enrique exclaimed. “Giordano can take
you to La Boca.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There,” another man said. “Giordano will convey
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giordano spread a boat rug for Hi. When Hi was
seated in the boat, he bent over a job of fitting two pieces
of wood together. He explained what he was doing, but
Hi could not understand. He sat in the boat, which
bobbed and rocked at the side of the steps. Giordano went
on with his work, whittling a piece of wood with his knife
and trying if the pieces would fit, then whittling some more.
Presently a boat shoved off from the pier beside them and
stood away for La Boca. Then another boat pushed off
and presently a third. But Giordano still went on with his
carpentry with no apparent thought of starting. Hi
thought that perhaps there had been some mistake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say,” he said, “you are going to La Boca, aren’t you?
You go La Boca?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Si,” Giordano answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went on trying to fit the pieces of wood. After some
time, with a gesture of triumph, he showed that at last
they fitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bueno,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet even now he made no effort to start. He rummaged
in the after locker and presently produced some nails,
which were bent, and a hammer with a broken handle.
Then he set himself to repair the hammer handle by lashing
another piece of wood to it. Next he rummaged among
the bottom boards of the boat for a pig of ballast. He
placed this on the stern sheets thwart as an anvil. Then
with great deliberation he began to straighten his nails.
Time seemed to have no meaning for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You go La Boca soon?” Hi asked. “La Boca
pronto?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Si, si.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he made no attempt to start. He hammered
his nails straight with great skill, then very neatly he
straightened the heads, which had been bent. Then he
rummaged for a file and touched up the points with it.
Another boat stood away from the pier towards La Boca.
Her helmsman called out something to Giordano, which
Giordano answered reflectively. After the boat had
gone he fitted the two pieces of wood together and with
great care drove his nails so as to clinch them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You start La Boca?” Hi asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Si, si. La Boca.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe the brute isn’t going to La Boca at all,” Hi
thought. “There, they’ve put out the pier light now.
I might have been at La Boca an hour ago. If there’s
another boat going, I would go in that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He clambered up the stairs of the pier to look for someone
who could speak English. The rush of the market was
now over. He found Enrique and his friends in a corner
among the baskets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to go at once, pronto, to La Boca,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Giordano go pronto,” they said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I want to go now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Si, si,” they said, “La Boca.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Si, si.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took off his hat to them and hurried along the pier
to the Englishman, who was still there, superintending the
packing of the jars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You want to go to La Boca?” he asked. “Oh well,
I wish I’d known. I thought you wanted one of the fish
hands. I could have sent you to La Boca an hour ago.
What do you want at La Boca?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have an appointment there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, who is your appointment with?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A friend,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man paused to say something to one of the packers,
then turned again to Hi.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who was your appointment with, did you say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah,” said the man, “what’s your friend’s name? I
only ask because I know La Boca, and it might be a question
of putting you ashore either to the north or to the south.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He will be at the inn,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which inn?” the man said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there more than one?” Hi asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is your friend an Englishman? What’s his name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excuse me,” Hi said, “but can you get me to La
Boca?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me see,” the man said, “did you mention your
name and your friend’s name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jones,” Hi said in desperation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Mr. Jones,” the man said, “if you’ll step along
with me, I’ll see if that boat’s gone that was here. Is it
your brother that you’re going to see in La Boca?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I see. Not a brother, only a friend. I don’t
remember the name of Jones in La Boca. What’s he doing
there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s only just gone there,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, a newcomer, like yourself. Well, this is the La
Boca boat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke to the master of the boat, who was putting what
is called a fish in the yard of his sail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That man will take you to La Boca,” the man said.
“He’s just going to start. If you had come to me on your
way, I could have sent you off in one of the vegetable boats
hours ago. Don’t give him more than two pesetas. By
the way, where will you be staying at La Boca, Mr. Jones?
If you or your friend should want any of these earthenware
jars, I am in a position to get them as cheap as anybody.
What initial did you say yours was?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And your friend’s?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“R,” Hi answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. H. and Mr. R. Jones,” the man said. “Where are
you stopping, did you say? Because I can get you nice
rooms in a boarding-house, which would be cheaper for you
than any hotel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here the boatman invited Hi into the boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are you stopping?” the man called. “Where
did you say you were stopping? I should like to call round
in the evening and see you, if you’re not doing anything.
They always say that Englishmen ought to stick together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi was about to answer, but the boom gybed at that
instant and knocked his hat into the well. The boat had
shoved off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Inquisitive beast,” Hi thought. “I never knew a man
ask questions like that before. I shouldn’t wonder if he’s
a detective put there to stop passengers leaving the city.
If that’s the case, I’ll very likely be stopped at La Boca. If
that devil telegraphs, I shall very likely be met at the
pier and shadowed. However, for the moment I am off.
That’s the main thing. But I’ve wasted simply hours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His boat passed close beside Giordano. He was bent
over his carpentry in deep attention, putting a whipping
over the join.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He doesn’t mean to start for another hour,” Hi thought.
“I am glad I tried to find someone starting sooner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The master of the boat, Chigo, the boatman, and Luigi,
the boy, ran up their new striped sails, so that the boat
leaned down and sheered the water. Then they brought
out bread, onions, wine and water and some little transparent
fish, which were meant to be eaten raw. They
invited Hi to their feast and all breakfasted together.
After breakfast, while the boat was still moving swiftly
to the south, Hi amused himself by looking into the shallow
water at the fish and the weeds of all the colours of the
rainbow. Presently something, which seemed like a piece
of the bottom of the bay, blundered up alongside, turned
over and seethed out of the water into a whiteish blunt
thing, which had a kind of cat’s mouth that clicked. The
click missed by at least two feet, as the thing did not aim
very well. It blundered over, rubbed against the side of
the boat with a slow rasping movement and disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A shark, by George,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boatman laughed at his scare and the master signed
to him not to lean over the side. Soon after this Hi
noticed that La Boca did not seem to be getting any nearer.
The wind, before falling, had drawn ahead, so that they
had to make a short board out to sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is a bore,” he thought. “I may not be at La
Boca till mid-day, if this goes on. But I’ll do it yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wind, which had drawn ahead, now chopped round
a few points to the west and failed altogether.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter?” Hi asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait for de breeze,” the master said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall we have to wait long?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sometimes half hour, sometimes hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would it be possible to row in to the shore?” Hi asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not got oars,” the boatman said. “Only one oar and
a boat hook.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was nothing for it but to wait while the sun
climbed up out of the sea and became hotter. Hi tried to
judge the distance from La Boca. It seemed so near across
that fore-shortened glitter of sea. Three miles, possibly
four miles, he thought. The sea and the boat seemed to
settle down to sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall be hours at it like this,” Hi thought. And
they were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What was hardest to bear came an hour later, as they lay
becalmed. Hi saw a boat further inshore creeping down
to La Boca under sweeps. Something in her helmsman’s
figure seemed familiar to Hi, who was watching her with
envy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that Giordano?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Giordano, si,” they answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was helped by more than the sweeps. She was a
better boat in light airs and, being much further inshore,
she missed the northward current then moving across the
outward bay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, we are further from La Boca than we were
before,” he thought. “We are drifting back. She will be
in hours before us and I might have been in her, if I had
had a little patience. I was an ass,” he thought. “If I
had only stuck to Giordano, I might have been almost
there now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no remedy but patience, which is no remedy
but a substitute. Hi watched Giordano’s boat edge on
and on. After what seemed to be hours he noticed that
the men in Giordano’s boat laid in their sweeps and tended
sails. Chigo, who had been watching for something of the
sort, laid aside his fender making.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here is the breeze,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The breeze came down to them with a darkening of the
water. Very gently the boat began to steal southward
again. At a little after ten o’clock they began to draw in
to the settlement of fishermen and market gardeners at the
mouth of the Miamia river. It was an array of little lime-washed
houses, roofed with red tiles. It had a mission
church of three bells. At the mouth of the river there was
a harbour made by baulks of green-heart timber, which
had been steeped in a red enamel as a defence against the
worm. Hi had been intent upon his thoughts, planning his
ride. Looking up, he saw that Giordano’s boat had not
entered the harbour, but had stood on down the coast
towards the south. Looking up at the dock in front of
him, he saw some Pituba soldiers watching the approach of
the boat. Among them was a white man, who seemed to
be an officer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just as I thought,” Hi said to himself. “That man
on the pier in the city was a detective. Now here I am
being shadowed and am going to be questioned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at this officer. He didn’t like his looks at all.
He looked too snappish and ill-tempered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A bite from that lipless mouth would be worse than
its bark,” he thought, “though the bark has a curse in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This man called out something to the master of the boat,
who stood up and answered with a question, which Hi
thought civilly put. It brought down a storm of oaths
from the officer, who repeated his original remark in the
tone of an order. Very politely the master again objected,
pointing to Hi.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” Hi whispered to Chigo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He tells us not to land,” Chigo whispered. “The
padron ask if you may land.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir,” Hi called to him, “I am English. May I not
land here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What you say?” the officer asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am English. May I land here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are Inglays?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Si.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Inglays?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Si.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Inglays with cat’s tripes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I say, yes. Meester Inglays with cat’s tripes, I
say, yes. Take your baboon-face hence lest I mistake it
for your stern and kick it. And tell your Inglays brothers
that this is not their land, but a land of men. It is not for
Inglays Miss, no tank you, nor for Meester Aow and Pipe
Tooth. You come here you be shot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d get into pretty hot water, if you shot me,” Hi
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d get into pretty hot water, if you shot me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What the pretty mouth say? I no catch?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll get into pretty hot water, if you shoot me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, dear, the Inglays Meester threaten me.” He came
a step or two nearer to the edge of the pier, so as to read
the number on the boat’s bows. “Padron,” he said,
“your boat, number B 71, is suspect. You will take your
boat down to Carpinche and report to the commandant
there. If you try to land anywhere nearer, you shall be
arrest, you and cat’s tripes; yes, and shot. To Carpinche:
go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The padron civilly asked whether there were any warrant
upon which he could be ordered to Carpinche.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” the officer said, “a very good warrant. The
proclamation of martial law.” Here he drew out a revolver.
“I command here for the Republic, which now scrapes off
the foreign lice that cling to her. You rebel, I shoot. To
Carpinche.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One moment, please,” Hi said. “I want to see the
English Consul here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no,” the padron said. “No consul here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, anyway, I’ve a right to land.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no,” Chigo whispered. “You get into trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does Miss tank you, the Inglays, say?” the
officer asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to see the English Consul,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he wants to see the Inglays Consul?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Inglays Consul, you say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tank you, but I not please. I tell you to go to Carpinche.
You know your Consul live in Santa Barbara,
where you just come from. Why you lie to me you want
him here? To Carpinche, or I send you back to your
Consul, on my ordnance mule, by phê, with your feet tied
under his belly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boat had by this time drifted across the mouth of the
harbour, where she caught a gust which drove her a few
yards out. The padron, who was in that land only to make
a living, shook his head, as he let the sails fill on the new
course. “We must to Carpinche,” he said. When the
boat was some lengths from the pier, he took a stiletto from
his boot and snicked it to and fro, passionately, on his
boot-leg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ise kill-a that man,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi hesitated. If he tried to land there, he might be
shot: if he did land, he might be sent back to Santa
Barbara.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is this Carpinche?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“South, ten miles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could I get a horse there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Si.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it far from Anselmo? A place called San Anselmo?
San An-selm-o?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“San Anselmo?” Chigo suddenly said. “Si, si. There.”
He pointed inland to the west.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can I get there from Carpinche?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To San Anselmo from Carpinche?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he said. “Can I get there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Si, si.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How far is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How far?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, how far?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Chigo debated with the padron; the boy made some
suggestions. They thought it might be forty kilometres,
thirty kilometres; perhaps not so much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twenty kilometres, we going there,” the padron said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Twenty kilometres was about eleven miles, Hi thought.
He tried to figure it out, how it could be so little, but
thought that these men might know. All the time the
boat was moving away from the pierhead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say that it is twenty miles,” Hi thought, “and this
ten miles more sailing added on to it, I shall not be there
till the afternoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See,” the padron said, to Hi, with reproach, “you
should not have angered the commandant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Chigo added. “If you not speak at all, if you
leave it to the padron, he let you land all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m blest if he would,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Si, si.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He would not have: he had refused.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, see,” Chigo explained, “the padron he explain:
he say what, that man not go any sense, he let you land
all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you ask, then he stop you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi could not see it as they saw it; but their point of
view, however, imperfectly grasped by him, added to his
trouble. What if they were right? What if he had been
hasty? What if he might have landed at the pier, had he
left it all to the padron?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t you turn back, then, and let me try him again?”
he asked. The padron shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not turn back,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He angry now,” Chigo said. “He shoot you now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, can you put me ashore somewhere near here, at
one of the little landing places?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ashore here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Si.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not now,” they said. “The commandant angry
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he would never know. He is not following the
boat, and cannot see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The padron shook his head with a gesture which meant
that it would be well not to think of any such thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Besides,” he said, “look, we are past the landing
places. We cannot take the boat in to the shore
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was true; a short way to the south from La Boca
the beach changed character from sandy to boulder-strewn.
The boulders were packed together almost like a paving of
cobbles, and as it were cemented with the broken shell of
the beach. It looked a bad beach to beach on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The boat is made only of very thin wood,” the patron
said, mainly by signs; “she bump and bump and bump and
knock herself all to pieces.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When we get to Carpinche,” Chigo said, “another
officer will say, ‘Back to La Boca.’ Then, when we come
back, Yellow Face will say, ‘Back to Carpinche.’ Thus we
shall pass our day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such are soldiers,” the padron said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not a cheerful prospect to Hi, but it seemed
possible and likely. “I may not be started before dark,”
he thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we have another commandant at Carpinche,” he
thought, “I’ll say nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carpinche lay in the south-west angle of the bay, among
wooded foothills. A dark, romantic glen of trees, marking
a water course, sloped inland from it in the easy places of
the hill. Great trees grew about Carpinche. The hill to
the south of the bay lay like a lioness crouched to drink
with her head between her paws. As they drew nearer to
this hill the wind failed them. “See,” Chigo said, “we
too near the shore: see? The shore stop the wind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blanketed,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The shore stops the wind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gusts of it came in a baffling way; then these, too,
ceased. They drifted rather than sailed into a place of
shelter, where the trees looked down into a water like
glass. The blackness of the rock near the shore made
the water seem deep as the pit. Chigo and the boy helped
the boat forward by paddling with her bottom boards. Hi
also took a bottom board and paddled, with thoughts of
that machine of which he had talked to Carlotta only the
day before. All four of them stared ahead for some sign
of soldiers: they could see none.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No commandant here,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Siesta,” the padron said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boat edged slowly into the Carpinche river towards
a village among the trees, which towered up there to a vast
height. The forest made the place dark, though glaring
light fell beyond. Giordano’s boat lay tied to the pier in
front of them. She had lain there for perhaps a couple of
hours. “Oh, if I had only stayed in her,” Hi thought,
“I might have been in Anselmo by this time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They edged alongside the pier and made fast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No commandant here to report to,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, the commandant,” the padron answered. “That
man a bad man. He know there no commandant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there an inn here where I could get a horse?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Si, si, in the village.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps,” Hi said, “since you have all been kind and
are here partly through me, you will all come with me to
the inn for some refreshment?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all accepted this: they set out along a track of
red earth which had recently been mud. The raised wooden
ways on each side of the track had lately been washed out
of position, so that they lay all poked up, like stretchers
on a battlefield. The village seemed dead save for a
yellow dog, who came out and howled at them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The people here get up very early,” the boatman
explained, “so they have siesta early.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the inn, half a dozen men, including Giordano, were
lying asleep on the benches or leaning over the table. The
boat-master called out to the hostess that here was a
gentleman who wished to hire a horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas,” the hostess said, “the horses are all gone
with the men to the fiesta. There will be no horses till
to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What then can the gentleman do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who knows?” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the sleepers at the table roused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are horses at the house at the cross roads,” he
said. “If he will ask there, he might have a horse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How far are the cross roads?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Four miles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are there no horses nearer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not here. All went early this morning to the fiesta.
At five or even at six you might have had your pick of
horses, but now there are none.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It occurred to Hi that, when he had paid for some drinks,
the hostess might be more helpful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ask her to serve some wine,” Hi said. “You deserve
the best wine after your morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hostess was pleased to serve wine, but the order
did not make her more forthcoming about horses. Plainly
there were none.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must go on to the cross roads then,” Hi said, “if you
will point out the road. I will try for a horse there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By his watch it was a quarter to two when he stepped
across the bridge, which led out of the village.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nearly ten hours,” he thought, “since Rosa called
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His track led uphill into the forest. “Now best foot
foremost,” he said to himself. “Never mind the heat
or anything else. You’ve got to save Carlotta and every
minute is precious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very soon the trees closed over the road, so that he
walked in the cool twilight of a tunnel. He saw nothing
remarkable for the first couple of miles. Then he came upon
a hare sitting upon its hind legs, seeming to be praying,
while a big snake sat opposite, swaying a little, making up
its mind to strike. Hi flung some stones at the snake,
which ducked its head and turned towards him with an
ugly raising of the crest. With a few more stones he drove
it away. He then walked to the hare and stroked it and
spoke to it. Its fur was sick and staring. Presently it fell
over on one side, recovered and went shambling away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What an ass my father is,” Hi thought. “He knew that
I might meet things like this, yet said that I should never
need a revolver. I shall need one twenty times a day.
If I came on one of these snakes asleep, I should never see
it until I trod on it. I had better have a stick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unfortunately there was no stick nearer than forty
feet from the ground. He was in a place which grew nothing
but feathery thorn and gigantic timber in a solitude which
might have been thousands of miles from men. Giving up
the stick, he went on for half an hour without seeing a soul.
The only living things he saw, apart from the flies, were
deer, moving like shadows among the trees, and very
bright things, which he supposed to be parrots against
the sky, when the sky showed. After he had walked for an
hour he saw a gleam of water below him; soon he came
to a wooden bridge at which some tracks converged.
There had been a ford or drinking place for cattle above the
bridge. This was now a collection of pockets of red mud
full of little snakes: beyond the bridge were houses; a
farm, somewhat old and untidy, built of wood in need of
paint, with stabling beside and behind it. Nearer to the
river were two very ramshackle sheds or cottages of wood,
which had once been tarred but were now rust-coloured.
Dirty bedding hung from the windows of these sheds.
Over the door of one of them was a tiling shingle on which
someone had drawn in tar, with his forefinger, the word</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>CAMAS</p>

<p class='noindent'>(with the final S reversed). To the left of these, well away
from the river, and on the other side of the road, was a
trim, white, prosperous looking house, with a tiled stable.
A cornfield of red earth strewn with the shocks of young
maize, stretched uphill behind this house. A fair-haired,
blue-eyed white man was hoeing among these maize
shocks, although it was the heat of the day. He was a
South German, who spoke a little English. He said that it
was fine vetter and that Hi might tank Gott for such fine
vetter. As for a horse, his brother had gone with the
horse to the fiesta, but the old frau in the house opposite
might lend her colt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a friendly, helpful young man. He took Hi
across the tracks to the old untidy farm where everybody
seemed to be asleep. Here, after they had both knocked
and called for some minutes, a negress appeared, rubbing
her eyes with her skirt. This girl took them through a
darkness, which stank, into a hot shuttered room, where
she called several times by whistling like a kite. When
something between a snarl and a gurgle answered to her
call, she opened the southward shutters so that Hi could see.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found himself near the door of a bare room, the floor
of which was trodden earth. A table, with fragments of
fruit upon it, stood against one wall. Against the end
wall, opposite the window, was a tall-backed red chair or
throne, in which an enormously fat old woman, swathed in
folds of black, sat blinking as she roused from sleep. She
was mopping her brow with the handkerchief which had
kept the flies from her face while she slept. Hi had the
feeling that she lived and slept in the chair. She had
a book of hours upon her lap; its marker, hanging from
a red ribbon, dangled from her knee. She soon checked
her gurglings: she woke up with great completeness. A
pair of sharp and very cold grey eyes shone out of her
vast pale face with that narrowed glimmer which made
Hi think of the snake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You want a horse?” she said, in fair English, in a
guttural voice that was half a cough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, please, Señora.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where will you go with the horse?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To Anselmo?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where to in Anselmo?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“George Elena’s house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When you bring him back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How far is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thirty kilometre: twenty kilometre. When you
bring my horse back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll send him back to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Send? Eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not bring him back yourself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I may not be coming back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who will bring him back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One of Elena’s men will bring him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What you do?” she asked after a pause. “Why you
go this way to Anselmo? Where you from?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Santa Barbara.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which way you come from there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Carpinche.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know the road to Anselmo?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; but I can find it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How you know you can?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have found you, Señora.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat staring at him, fanning her face with her handkerchief;
her face was without more expression than a
large uncut ham.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What you going to do in Anselmo?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve business with George Elena.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What business?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Horses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why you come this way, if you go on business? This
ain’t the way. Why you not go the proper road?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi wavered at the question, but said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought it might be quicker to sail down the bay and
come this way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long you been here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three or four days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Horses,” she grunted in a tone of great disgust. She
fanned herself, looking over Hi’s head at the wall. There
was no expression on her face, but her big jaw worked a
little: she was solving the problem of what brought Hi
there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I got no horse,” she said at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This, besides being ungracious, was false. Hi felt that
she spoke thus because she was cross from being wakened
and did not want to be bothered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tell him, maybe you lend your colt,” the German said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I got no horse to lend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, of course, Señora,” Hi said. “I don’t ask you to
lend him. I want to hire him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How much you pay?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How much do you want, for the two days?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What you pay?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you usually charge?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How much you pay? I can’t be buyer and seller, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know how much these things cost in this
country,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what you give, see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi produced his peseta notes and small change, to
which the woman made an emphatic gesture that this
was child’s play.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, how much, then?” Hi asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A tall, lean man had come silently into the room behind
Hi; he had taken up his position facing Hi, with his
back against the table. He was picking his teeth with a
sprig of macilente, which he chewed. Hi did not like the
fellow’s looks. He had almost no brow; his hair and
eyebrows merged into each other. Under this shag, the
man’s eyes were very black; his face was hungry-looking,
with pale, sunken cheeks. The mouth was greedy-looking
or wolfish, although it split into a smile over the toothpick.
The teeth glittered; they looked evil, being pointed
and inclined inward, something like snakes’ fangs. His
ear-rings glittered at each bite upon the sprig. There
was a glittering about the man’s person, apart from ear-rings
and teeth, because his waistcoat was buttoned up
to the throat with some thirty small globular silver
buttons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All is not gold that glitters,” Hi thought. “Mr.
Bright Tooth, you look like a wolf who would scratch up
a grave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, how much, do you think, would be fair for a
horse for two days?” Hi asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman fanned herself for a moment, then she said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, we not know you. You may be very fine
gentleman, but we not know you. My horse, all the horse
I got. You want to go to Anselmo? That fifty kilometre,
forty kilometre from here through the forest;
pumas in the forest; eat horses; then you go over the
fords; the fords all out with rain. Very like you get my
horse drowned. Then you not know how to look out. You
get the horse bitten by snakes, or else you lose your
way. Then suppose you reach Anselmo. You say, that old
woman, pah, she not want her horse. I got to Anselmo,
what the hell, see? How I to know you send the horse
back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I promise you I will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Promise. Look. I’m a woman: see? I don’t believe
any promise any man ever make. When a man want a
thing, he promise anything. Does he pay? Nit, I don’t
think; with the fore sheet, what? So don’t promise me
nothing, Albert; it’s pretty to hear you, but it don’t
lead to nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bright Tooth entered the conversation with the question:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You got English sovereign?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi had three English sovereigns; he offered one of
them, which at that time, in that country, would have
bought two horses, with their harness, outright. After
some more haggling, backed by Bright Tooth, the old
woman agreed to lend a horse, saddled and bridled, for
two days, for one English sovereign and all the small
change Hi had. It was, however, agreed that this small
change, amounting to seventeen Santa Barbara pesetas,
should be returned to the man who brought back the horse.
Hi thought that they drove a very hard bargain with him;
but to have a horse and to be away upon his journey were
the desires of his heart at the moment. Even so, he knew
enough not to pay for a horse till he had a little knowledge
of it. He asked to see the horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bright Tooth led him out to the yard at the back of the
house, with the remark that he was a very nice horse, a
horse for a king or queen, being tireless and good spirited,
as well as so beautifully boned. Hi had heard horses sold
in England, by his father. He waited till they were in the
stable, where two horses were in stalls. The one nearer to
the door was a nice dark chestnut mare, which seemed
somehow, even at a first glance, a little too good for such
a stall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is this the horse?” Hi asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Bright Tooth said, “the other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other was a sour-coloured pony engaged at that
minute in gnawing off the top of the partition between the
stalls. He was doing this with an ugly chucklehead
screwed sideways, so that his yellow hooked teeth might
get a purchase on the splinter. He was rough-haired,
having been out in the rains (apparently in a hog wallow).
The hair, stuck to patches of mud, was scaling off him.
He had not been shod nor had his feet been pared. They
stuck forward in long, splitting growths of horn almost like
slippers. A sort of gaiter of hard red mud coated his legs
to his hocks. He was straight-shouldered, and what old
Bill always called “a bit goosey in the rump.” His head,
when he ceased from gnawing the barrier, was loutish and
ill set on. “Stunsail ears and a Roman nose,” Hi thought.
“Worth six bob a corner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is a horse,” Bright Tooth said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, in the catalogue ye go for horse,” Hi quoted to
himself, from the Macbeth his form had “done” the term
before. “Good Lord,” he said aloud, “I can’t take a
beast like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, a lovely horse,” Bright Tooth said. “Never
fail. He never, never fail. There come soldiers here for
horses, one time. They say, he too small, not allowed to
take so small a horse; but that the horse for a soldier;
he got the good guts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guts. Good Lord,” Hi said. “He’s got no more guts
than a herring. I never saw such a beast in all my born
days. Let me have the other, the mare.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not,” Bright Tooth said. “The other one not
belong here. She not our horse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whose is she? Perhaps I could hire her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no,” Bright Tooth said, “she wait here till after
the fiesta; then the man come to ride her home. He be
here in a few minutes now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In a few minutes?” Hi said. “I could wait a few
minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He not be here in a few minutes. I make mistake, see.
This yellow horse the only horse. He go like the wind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With those feet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tell you about those feet. The rains make it very
slippy. With those feet he never, never fail: any kind of
mud, any kind of stick, he stand fast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll bet he will stand fast,” Hi said. “Is there no
other horse?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No other horse anywhere, except the mare. And the
man who owns the mare, he very proud man; he not let
anyone ride the mare.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, all right, then,” Hi said, “I suppose I must take
the pony. Let me see the saddle and bridle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old woman had hobbled to the stable, the German
had gone back to his work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like to see the colour of your money,” the old woman
said. “I not know you, see, so you make me a little
present.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi paid over the money, which mother and son (if that
was, as he supposed, the relationship between the pair)
watched with eyes that burned with voracity. The old
woman bit the sovereign, to test its goodness, as though
she were going to eat it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You go armed, in case of robbers?” the old woman
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.” Hi said. “Rather.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was feeling at the moment uneasy about this couple,
lest they should go back upon their bargain and deny the
horse, after taking the money. But the man Bright Tooth
saddled and bridled the horse and led him out. Hi noticed
that the pony was an arm-snapper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll borrow this stick of yours,” he said, picking up a
crooked stick which rested against the wall. “Your beast
is too free with his nippers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where you keep your gun?” the old woman asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In my pocket, all ready,” Hi said. He noticed that
she had a sharp eye upon his pockets as he mounted.
“Now, which way to Anselmo?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She swung her hand round to the west, to point to the
track leading past the German’s house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Straight on,” she said, “past the ford and out of the
wood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, and how far is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seventy kilometre: sixty kilometre.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, rats, Señora,” Hi said, “it can’t be. You said it
was twenty a little while ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quien sabe?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bright Tooth stepped down the yard from them to open
the gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Adios, Señora,” Hi said, moving off. It was twenty-seven
minutes to four; but he felt that he was now really
started. A kind of gleam came upon the Señora’s face:
the horse with the slippered feet clacked slowly down the
slope to the track. Hi saw the German leaning on his
hoe, watching him as he drew near.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch8'>VIII</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>he German</span> came slowly towards him, waving
with his left arm towards the left.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dot der way to Anselmo,” he said. “You
mind out at der ford.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you for your help,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very welcome.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German turned back to his hoeing and Hi set out
upon his path. When he was out of sight of that settlement,
really on his way to Anselmo, he thought of those
warning words, “You mind out at the ford.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You meet highwaymen at the fords,” his father had
said, “or did in my day, but I expect it’s all altered since
then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder what that German meant,” he thought.
“Perhaps that devil Bright Tooth may be playing some
trick, but probably what he meant was that the floods are
out. It will be rotten if I can’t get across.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the question rose in his mind how far Anselmo was.
“Twelve or fifteen miles,” he thought. “I can be there
by 5 or 5.30 and I will be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He whacked up the horse into a solitude of rocky barren,
densely grown with small thorn and prickly pear. The
strangeness of the landscape, the blueness of the sky where
the eagles were cruising for their prey and the glory of the
adventure on which he rode made his ride a dream of
delight for some miles, till the rocks on both sides of him
grew in towards him, so that he rode in a kind of gully,
where the hooves made more echo than he liked. The
gloom of the place was made greater by the prevalence of
the pudding-cactus, which exuded over his path like jellyfish
flecked with blood or snakes which had been pressed to
death. Multitudes of flies feasting on the stickiness of
the plant gave it the appearance of corruption. In nearly
all the puddles there were snakes. The noise of the echoes
of the horse’s hooves became louder and louder. Hi,
looking back, saw that a horse and man were coming after
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man was bent down in his seat with his sombrero
jammed down over his eyes. He had a look of Bright
Tooth. His horse looked like the dark chestnut mare
which Hi had seen in the stable. She had seemed a beauty
then, if a little small. She showed like a beauty now in the
grace of her going.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s Bright Tooth all right,” Hi thought. “I’ll bet
he comes for no good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seeing that he was seen, the man sat up and called to Hi
to stop. He was certainly Bright Tooth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should I stop?” Hi thought. “I am not going
to stop for a swine like that. Let him jolly well catch me
up and explain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he saw that Bright Tooth was not carrying a gun, he
rode on, though Bright Tooth called repeatedly something
about stopping or returning, to which Hi answered, “Si,”
or “Bueno” or “That’s the ticket.” Bright Tooth pressed
his horse up to Hi’s off quarter with the cry, “You Englishman
return.” He motioned back towards the cross roads.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not going to return,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you give back the horse, see?” Bright Tooth
cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see,” Hi said. “Why should I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were now riding side by side at a good speed,
because both horses thought that it was a race.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You turn back, see,” Bright Tooth cried. He motioned
backwards, shaking his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, old sport,” Hi said. He did not turn, nor
did he mean to turn; he kept on, with an eye for the road
and the next move. He shoved his stick into his bridle
hand, so as to have his right hand free.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give up the horse, see?” Bright Tooth cried again.
“Your money bad. Bad English money.” He gave a
violent imitation of biting a coin and being sick. “You
come back,” he cried, “or pay good money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rats,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your money bad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The money was good,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You pay more money. Another sovereign, see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t pay a red cent more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bright Tooth shot forward, stooped and made a clutch
at Hi’s rein. The yellow horse shied away from him, so
that he missed his clutch and nearly fell. Hi, too, was
nearly off. He recovered first. He dropped his right
hand to the pocket where he kept his knife. He poked the
end of the knife from within the pocket towards Bright
Tooth, as though it were a revolver muzzle. He had read
somewhere of men shooting through the pocket. He
called out, “All right, old sport, I’ve got you covered.
Cuidado.” He did not know what cuidado meant; but
he had heard the third officer in the <span class='it'>Recalde</span> use the word
as an alarm note. He saw Bright Tooth whip out a knife
with a blade a foot long, sharp on two edges and spear-pointed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They looked at each other a few feet apart. Hi enjoyed
it, because Bright Tooth did not attack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You pay another sovereign,” Bright Tooth said. There
was about Bright Tooth a sort of suggestion of a rush
preparing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Clear out,” Hi said, “clear right out of it. Get back
where you belong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You give the bad money,” Bright Tooth said; there
was a whine in his voice. Hi edged towards him; he
edged away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Clear out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bright Tooth cleared out. He turned, in an anxious
manner, to a point ten yards away. As Hi turned after
him, he retreated hurriedly for fifty or sixty yards; then,
as Hi still slowly followed, he retreated further.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You keep where you are. Don’t you try to follow me,”
Hi called. He tapped his pocket, and added, “This is
what you’ll get, if you try any monkey-tricks with me,
my son.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He watched Bright Tooth for half a minute; then, as
he seemed not disposed to try any monkey-tricks, he
turned again upon his way through the woodland across
the puddings of the cactus. Whenever he looked back he
saw Bright Tooth following. If he paused, Bright Tooth
paused. If he turned back, Bright Tooth turned back.
When he went on, Bright Tooth followed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t done with him yet,” Hi thought. “He knows
of some place ahead where he can get me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After some time he passed a turning to the right. Looking
back, he saw Bright Tooth turn down this track at a
quickened pace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s riding to head me off,” Hi thought. “I wish I
had at least a club.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was, however, no chance of getting a club in that
wood. He rode on into a meaner country and from this
to a forest darker than the last, where he could hear nothing
except a murmur or steady beat like the noise of water
somewhere ahead. “That’s the ford,” Hi thought, “and
the river’s in spate. Well, the longer I think of it, the less
I shall like it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Almost at once the forest became sparser. He rode out
on to a hill of moist red soil, at the foot of which was a
violent little river, blood-red and bank high. Tracks led
to what had been a ford there, but the water was romping
over the ford in a way terrible to see. Not far below the
ford the water went down a rapid. Near the ford, where
the tracks ceased to be boggy, Bright Tooth and a friend
sat on horses waiting for him. Bright Tooth had his knife,
the friend had a revolver. “Here we are,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They signed to him to come forward and moved towards
him. Hi had not any time for thought; he moved on the
impulse of the moment. He banged his horse forwards
down the slope towards the water in such a way that he
could not stop, even had he wished. He yelled as he went.
His horse went scattering down the slope. The man
struck at him and someone shot at him. The water went
up suddenly in a bright sheet over him and then he was in
the hands of the river. In the first rush of the fall he lost
his horse, and nearly choked with the filthy water in his
mouth. Catching a gulp of air, he saw his horse again as
the banks of the stream ran away from him. Then he saw
Bright Tooth on a jibbing mare gathering the coils of a
lasso for a swing. Then he was tumbled headlong and
endlong down into a roaring pit that banged him and
wouldn’t let him get his breath. He felt that he had
tumbled down all the stairs in Christendom. The tumbling
and banging seemed to last through this life into eternity.
In another few seconds, when he had leisure to open his
eyes, he was in a round, filthy, surging pool, where boughs,
shrubs, trees and drowned beasts were milling and churning
amid enormous bubbles of red yeast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Striking out to the side of this, he came to a steep bank
covered with trailers of bindweed dripping down upon him.
Putting down his feet, he touched rock and stood. He
caught the trailing plants, waded to the bank and then
felt suddenly faint. Holding on to the trailers, he saw that
they were not the bank, but a screen to it. Behind them
was a cave, into which the sun shone. He clambered into
this and lay down upon a water-smoothed rock, closed his
eyes and wished that the world would stop spinning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After he had lain there for some minutes he heard voices.
Through the creepers he could see Bright Tooth and his
friend on the other bank of the river, peering for his body.
Presently he saw them lie down upon the bank in an effort
to see under the creepers which hid him. They went up
the stream for a little, then went down it, then came back
to point, jabber and explain their theories over the pool.
He could see what was in their minds. Bright Tooth
thought that he had been washed underneath the bank.
His friend thought that he had been jammed under water in
the pool. They were there, watching the water, for a full
quarter of an hour. Suddenly he saw them exclaim and
point at something. The body of the sour colt, which had
jammed in a snag in the rapids, came blindly down. The
current shot it over to Bright Tooth’s side on the way down-stream.
He saw them watch for the rider, but no rider
followed. After some more searching and consulting, the
two seemed to be agreeing to return later, when the water
had fallen. They mounted and surveyed the water from
their saddles and then slowly rode away with many glances
back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They won’t be gone for long,” Hi said to himself.
“They will come back separately soon, each hoping to find
me before the other has a chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as they were hidden from him by the forest,
Hi ventured out of his cover. By a little scrambling among
slippery rocks he found a way out of the river-bed to the
dry land. He saw the sour colt’s body drifting across a
rock in mid-stream. The rage and rush of the filthy falls
down which he had come made him marvel that he was not
jammed there with the horse. He went on into the scrub
away from the river till he came to a pool in the hollow of
a rock. Here he stripped, washed, dried his clothes in the
hot sun and took stock of his position. His nose was
swollen and uncomfortable; he had an after-football
feeling that he would be very stiff in the morning. “But
that’s nothing,” he thought, “I ought to be thankful to be
still alive.” His horse and hat were gone; his watch had
stopped at seven minutes to five. His money was safe;
among the coins were two crumpled, soaked ten peseta
notes, which he had forgotten; he dried these carefully.
He had a pocket-book, a knife, two handkerchiefs, a box
of matches, which he dried one by one, a pair of pocket-scissors,
some string, two pencils and a small shield-shaped
silver locket containing camphor. His sister Bell had
given this to him at Christmas; he had carried it with him
ever since.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All his clothes looked as though they had been dipped
in old blood, but they soon dried in the sun on that hot
rock. He made his second handkerchief into a sunbonnet.
His tie, which had been black with green spots, had spread a
greenish black tinge all over his collar; the tie itself looked
like a snake which had been run over. He judged that he
would look more like a tramp with these two things than
without them, so he left tie and collar under a bush, with
a qualm, that he was leaving bits of England there. “The
Elenas,” he thought, “will fit me out with a tie and collar
when I reach Anselmo. After all, everybody has a collar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now,” he added, “I will be off for Anselmo, as
hard as I can put foot to ground. It can’t be more than
eight miles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Away from the river the ground was desert-like and
hard, growing scrub, mezquite, cactus and prickly pear in
the spaces clear of rock. He picked up the trail for Anselmo,
and went on at a good pace till he came out into the
sage in the open country. He had often heard his father
speak of the Santa Barbara landscape, now he saw it in its
sweep, with the mountains near at his left, Gaspar thrusting
out in front of them, above a rolling plain over which the
wind exulted. Santa Barbara made a smudge against the
paleness of the lower sky far behind him to his right. In
front was this infinity of swaying sage, which ran on into
grass for hours and hours of going. The forest lay dark to
the left, all over the foothills of the Sierras; but one could
not look at the darkness with all that light to choose.
Straight in front of him, how far away he could not tell, in
that clear light, which had so often deceived him already,
was a round hill topped by a tower. It seemed to be not
much more than a mile away in that clearness. The tower
was foursquare and tall. One of its angles was topped by
the figure of an angel clasping a banner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is it,” Hi said, “there it is. That is Anselmo
tower; the village must be beyond the hill; I shall be at
the Elenas in half an hour. Oh, cheers; come on, now, for
the last lap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was so much cheered by the sight of his landmark
that he began to run towards it. Soon he drew clear of
a patch of scrub into sight of the great south road from
Santa Barbara to Meruel. It went straight from the city
across his path through a copse or woodland half a mile in
front of him. On the road, coming from the city towards
this wood, were four ox-waggons each with teams of eight
oxen. He could see the slow, stately lurch of each swaying
ox and hear the songs and cries of the negro teamsters.
They were going with heavy loads. The whips cracked
like rifle shots; the soft tenor voices adjured the oxen to
pull in the names of countless saints. Hi saw a waggon
enter the cover of the copse, then a second, then a third,
then the last, but as he went on he did not see them emerge
on the other side. “They can’t have stopped for siesta
at this time,” he thought. “I suppose they are taking a
halt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went on towards the copse or little wood, watching
idly, as one will, for the teams to emerge on the other side.
They did not appear, so that he thought suddenly, “I
know what it is; there is a turning in the wood towards
Anselmo. They have turned off to Anselmo, and so of
course the wood hides them. Yet that can’t be, either; for
they aren’t singing nor cracking their whips. I suppose
they have pulled up for maté or a cigarette.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It took him longer than he had expected to reach the
copse. When he was close to its edge, he heard from
within it a sudden scream of pain followed by the laughter
of men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What on earth is that?” he thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He broke into the covert, past a water; he heard voices
and horses, and smelt woodsmoke and tobacco; soon he
came out into the open upon a curious scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For three hundred years, carters and horsemen using
that road had turned into that copse to camp or siesta. A
wide space on both sides of the road had been browsed and
trampled clear; the cleared ground was black with old
camp-fire marks. In the road, in the midst of this cleared
and trampled space, the four teams of oxen stood with
straying bent heads in front of their waggons. All about
them was a troop of Pituba lancers, perhaps fifty strong,
who had been halted there boiling maté at little reed fires
when the waggons had come in upon them. Now the
lancers were standing guard over the teamsters, who were
being questioned by their captain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi recognised the captain at once. He was the little,
short, fierce, bullet-headed snappy man who had forbidden
him to land at La Boca. His yellow eyes were still bloodshot
with rage. He was barking at one of the teamsters,
who had perhaps made some rash or unfortunate reply.
After he had sworn at this man, he gave an order to some
of his men, who threw the teamster to the ground and bent
his head down to his knees. Two Indians then pressed a
piece of wood across the back of his neck and lashed it
there with strips of hide. Hi knew at once that they were
going to make the man what is called a broody hen; his
father had told him of this torture. But before the order
could be given to complete the trussing of the victim, the
officer looked up, and recognised Hi.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah,” he said, “the Inglays from La Boca; the Inglays
with the too much talk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Si,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you did not land at Carpinche as I bade?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” the officer said. “But what does Mr. Inglays
do here, on the Meruel Road, after being told to stay in
Carpinche?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to Anselmo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To Anselmo? And where is your permit to go to
Anselmo?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely I do not need a permit. I am English.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So? He does not need a permit: he is Inglays.
To whom is the Inglays going in Anselmo?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not going to anybody. I want to see that angel
on the tower.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, to see the angel on the tower? A holy Inglays.
You will come to Ribote, where your angel of the tower
shall be a little searched into. You are under arrest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m English,” Hi said. “I have not broken any of
your laws. You had better let me go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is for me to judge whether to let you go,” the
officer said, “and whether you have broken the laws.
You are walking without a permit on a forbidden road.
You will come with me to Ribote.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I can prove that I am doing no harm,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you can prove it, you can prove it at Ribote,” the
officer answered. “But to Ribote you will certainly come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned his back upon Hi. He left him in charge of two
troopers, while he strolled away to drink his maté. When
he had finished his maté, he gave orders that Hi should
mount a spare horse. When the troop had formed up,
with Hi in the midst of them, they set off at a quick pace
along the great road to the south. It was half-past five,
as Hi judged, when they set out. The mountains were
stretching their shadows like fingers along the plain.
Glancing back, he saw the angel of the tower of Anselmo
growing smaller and smaller. “We are miles from Anselmo
now,” he thought. “It will be midnight now before I can
get there.” He had no fears for himself. “They won’t
really dare to harm me,” he thought, but he did bother
acutely about the delay of the message. “Here’s the
whole day gone,” he thought, “and I haven’t started yet
and these beasts may jail me for a week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was going, as far as he could judge, south or south
with a little east in it. Presently they were riding in the
dark, except for a flaring lower sky behind them and the
young moon westering over the plain. “This is ten miles,”
he thought, “or fifteen miles from Anselmo. I am no
nearer than I was in Santa Barbara.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At about seven or later he saw lights in front of him
running up a slope. They came into a town of some size
built on the side of a hill, which was crowned with pine
trees. “Here is Ribote,” he thought. The town, though
it was mainly a collection of wooden houses, was lit with
electric light. Near the entrance of the town there was
a big enclosure containing a mansion. The troop rode past
this, up the hill to an important stone building, which
looked like a large public-house partially converted into a
Greek temple. As it had a flagstaff with two small guns
in front of it, Hi judged it to be the city hall. The troop
halted outside this hall. The officer with about a dozen
men dismounted, drew their revolvers and entered. Perhaps
thirty seconds later there came a cry from within and shots
were fired. A few minutes later, three men, the better sort
of citizen, were brought out from the hall. As the officer
brought these men into the open, he caught sight of Hi,
whom he seemed to have forgotten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here is this Inglays again,” he said. “You shall rest
from your horse ride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said something to a native in a ragged blue uniform,
who looked like a sweeper or a porter of the building.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it is so,” he said. “You shall rest awhile to
consider the angel on the tower and other matters. You
shall have your hands free, so that you can catch your lice.
You will find some brother Inglays where you are going.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi realised that he was going to be jailed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir,” Hi said, “will you please let me go? I am not
a subject of this State.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir, we will please let him go,” the officer said. “He
is not a subject of this State.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man in the blue rags led the way into the house.
The officer ordered the Indians to take Hi in after him. Hi
was thrust along a hall into a corridor, then across a yard,
paved with concrete, to a low building or shed, where the
ragged man unlocked a door. When the door was opened,
Hi was flung through it. He went staggering for a couple
of steps, stumbled over a body which grunted, staggered on
and trod upon a second body, which roused up, cursed in
English and subsided.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door clicked to and the lock turned. The key was
withdrawn and the footsteps of the jailer passed away across
the yard. A door closed behind them. It seemed to Hi
to shut him into an “everlasting prison, remediless.”
He apologised to the two bodies, on which he had trodden,
but had no answer, except drunken muttering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am jailed,” he thought, “locked up in a jail and can’t
get out. And I can’t tell when I shall get out. I may be
here for days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a little time the room seemed less dark. He
began to have glimmerings of its shape. There was a
grated opening high up which let in air. A little grating
in the door let him peer into the yard. It was a biggish,
long prison room about twenty-four feet by eight. There
were three people in it, a dead drunk man, a less drunk man
and himself. The dead drunk man was out of all knowledge
of the world. The second, from words uttered when trodden
on, Hi judged to be a deserter from the Navy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peering through the grating, he could see little beyond
except the four concreted sides of the yard sloping to a
central drain. An evergreen stood in a tub at each corner
of the yard. The slopes of the pent-houses surrounding
the yard kept him from sight of the heavens, but a glimmer
in the water of the drain showed that the stars were shining.
He shook at the door, which rattled a little. It was an
iron slab. He was a prisoner. “And Carlotta is a prisoner,”
he thought. “And how on earth is Don Manuel to be
warned?” He saw no way. “They’ve diddled us
between them,” he thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While he stood at the little grating, rattling at the
door, a great tumult broke out at the lower end of the
town where Hi had seen the mansion. After twenty
minutes of this he noticed that the pent-house on his right
began to take colour. A glow came upon the tiles. The
racket continued for half an hour. “They’re having a
good old racket of destruction,” he thought. When he
looked again through the grating, he noticed that the glare
upon the tiles of the pent-house had changed to a glittering
intermittence. “I believe they’re burning the town,” he
thought. “If they are, we shall be burned like rats in a
trap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What say?” a voice asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi looked round startled. He saw the second of the
two drunkards sitting up and looking at him. He was a
littleish man with a flushed hatchet face which shone in
the light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The town’s on fire,” Hi said; “we may be burnt if they
don’t let us out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The town’s on fire: we may be burnt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Ere, let me come on deck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came on deck, a little unsteady on his legs and
smelling very strong of aniseed. “Damn to hell,” he said,
when he had come on deck and looked through the grating.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A bit of fair old, rare old,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned on Hi suddenly to ask:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What you in for, mate?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing. They shoved me in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s me, to rights,” he answered. “Nothing:
same ’ere. Burning’s pineful, too. Let’s ’ave a look at
that door. Say, mate, got a bit of wire?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.” Hi said, “I haven’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man took hold of the door, struck a match and examined
the lock. He lit a cigarette before the match burned
out. He had a packet of cigarettes. Hi thought him
rather scurvy not to offer him one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve not got a bit of wire?” the man said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi said he hadn’t.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you doing here?” the man said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come to learn sugar-planting,” Hi said. “What are
you doing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None of your damned business,” the man said. “If I’d
got a bit of wire,” he said, “I’d soon have this door open.
But you haven’t got a bit of wire?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a proper barracker. Coo lummy, she ain’t
half caught fire. The skylight’s no cop, neither. It’s a
bit of all Sir Garnet, if you ask me. You ain’t got a bit
of wire?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here the other drunkard gurgled in his sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cor blimey,” the little man said, “what was that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The other man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What other man? I didn’t know there was another
bloke; that’s straight. Lummy, ’e’s been in luck. ’E’s
enjoyed ’is lunch. I’ll ’ave a look, see, if ’e’s got a bit of
wire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was down on his knees on the instant, rummaging in
the drunkard’s clothes; for more than wire, Hi thought.
He sucked his cigarette to a glow till his face shewed
sharp as a wolf’s over the body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bleeding bit,” he said at last. “The grating’s
out of reach too, unless I stood on your back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on,” Hi said. “Stand on it, and try.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right,” the man said. “Tuck in your tuppeny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi tucked in his tuppeny beneath the window, the little
man made a run and leap and fell over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mizzled the bleeding dick,” he said. “I’ll do it
next time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next time he did do it; he leaped on to Hi’s back
and poised there; he was a horrid weight, but Hi was
struck by the ease and certainty of the jump, and also
by the silence of his tread: he was wearing old white deck
shoes with rubber soles. He felt the man try the gratings
by heaving all his weight on them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a give in the whole bleeding barrow,” the man said,
leaping lightly down. “Now if old Alf was along, what
got out of Princetown, it would be all right, wouldn’t it?
You ain’t got a bit of wire?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Alf a mo’; go easy,” the man said. “You ain’t seen
my cap since you come in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It ought to be somewheres, unless they pincht it.
It’s a fair barracker when they pinch kit as well as quod a
bloke. You ain’t got a cap: did they pinch yours?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No: I had none.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cor blimey, I’d a sweet jag; coo. This sweet shumpine,
the sime the toffs; coo. But you feel it in the sweetbreads;
that’s where it is; next day’s the day; that’s
straight. Say, mate, would you mind looking for me
cap. This grilling’s a steak’s game.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They groped on the floor for the cap; the glare without
increased so that they could see a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll be as nice as mother makes it, no bleeding error,”
the man said. “If we don’t get out of here, we’ll be
bleeding pancakes; that’s straight. Cor blimey, I seen
men burned. Coo, kid; it’s a barracker, being burned;
a fair barracker. You can always tell when a man’s dead,
when you see him being burned; yes, you can, because.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Cor blimey, here’s me cap. Nar then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He struck another match, lit another cigarette, and
rummaged swiftly at his cap in the glow at the door
grating.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Got a bit ’a wire,” he said. “Nar then, to be or not to
be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had taken the piece of wire which made the frame for
the top of his cheese-cutter cap. With this, when he had
bent it in a certain way, he began to fish within the lock,
using a niceness of touch which Hi had not expected from a
drunkard. He took some little time. The lock rattled and
clicked under his fishing: often he swore a little and
readjusted his wire. Once he stopped to look at the glare
upon the tiles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It won’t ’alf be a bit of real life,” he said, “if the
fire reaches Matiro’s. ’E’s got seventy tons of blasting
powder under where ’e keeps ’is chickens. Cor, mate,
that’ll mike them think the bleeding post’s come: seventy
ton. Now, you bleeder, I’ve got you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very delicately, he brought pressure to bear on the
tough twisted wire: the lock turned: the door opened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s the bleeding door,” the man said. “We’d
best hop it, mate. What’s the way out is the barracker
for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Across the yard and then through the house,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They set out across the yard; some rats in the drain
sat up to look at them. Hi saw their eyes glisten. All was
still in the municipio. The door into the building was shut
but not locked; Hi opened it and peered into a dark
passage droning with mosquitoes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s through here, then to the right,” Hi whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lummy,” the man said, “I ain’t half got the sours in
my sweetbreads.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must get the other man out,” Hi whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What other man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The drunk man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Garn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can’t leave him to be burned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Burned. Blimey, you can see the fire ain’t anyways
near. Besides, ’e’s bin lunching; ’e’s necked all what
come in the waggon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ll get him out of the cell anyway. Will you
give me a hand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No bleeding fear.” The man passed into the passage
and closed the door noiselessly behind him. Hi stole back
to the cell to rouse the drunkard. It was strange how
differently the glare of the fire seemed from the yard. It
was not near at hand, but at the far end of the town. All
the same, it was burning fiercely and perhaps drawing near
to Matiro’s. Hi shook the drunkard’s arm.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch9'>IX</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>“C</span>ome</span> along,” Hi said, “wake up. Come on out
of this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that?” the man said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wake up, man,” Hi said, “we’ve got the door open;
we can get away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man sat up, pulled out a sheath-knife, spat, and
said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll cut your guts out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind my guts,” Hi said, “they’ll keep; but we
may be spotted, if we don’t hurry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Garrrr,” the man screamed, “Garrrr and guts. See?
Garrrr and guts. Harrar.” He rose upon his feet, with
a brandish of his knife. “Come on the lot of you,” he
yelled, “you don’t daunt me. I’m Henery Peach Kezia
and my blood’s vitriol. I’ll seal you for your tombstone.
Harrar you planets, I’ll put some of your lights out, once
I get a hold of you.” Here he lifted up his voice into a
yell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ayayayayay,” he yelled, “I’m the frog who would
a-wooing go. See me hop.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hop out of the door,” Hi said. He held the door so
that the frog might hop. He was frightened not only of
the madman, but of his noise, which might bring the
guards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s the door?” the man asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s here?” the man asked. “How am I to know
where <span class='it'>here</span> is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you blind?” Hi asked. “I didn’t know you were
blind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I been blind since I was a poor little orphan child,” the
man said. “I only smell things. There’s a smell of roses
here, or maybe it’s lavender. You guide me to the door,
my dear young Bible friend. Just reach me your hand
and the blessings of the poor blind man will follow you.
Oh, Heaven bless you, my sweet young gentleman angel,
Heaven will bless you for this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi had taken the man by the left arm, while he kept the
door open with his body. The man came unsteadily
through the opening into the yard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There,” he said, “there.” He drew a deep breath,
suddenly wheeled upon Hi, stabbed at him with his knife,
and screamed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now I’ll cut your guts out, like I said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi had half expected something of the kind. By a twist
of his body he shook himself clear, so that the door, at once
swinging-to, struck Henery Peach Kezia and made him
miss his stab.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you think to dodge me like that, when my
blood’s up,” Kezia said, “you young swine. I’ll cut you
double for that. I’ll cut you crossways, so’s your own
mother will deny you.” He began to laugh with a deep
down, joyless chuckle, which made Hi’s blood run cold.
He was not very steady on his feet, but he had a horrid
danger about him, because of his sideways lurches. Hi
dodged him in his rush, but not by much, for they were on
the concrete slopes of the yard and Hi wore English walking-shoes,
the man stockings. It was as bright as bright
moonlight from the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, then,” Kezia said. “Now we’ll see. Some
would have took pity on you; but not me. Do you see
jouncer? This knife’s jouncer. And as soon as I’ve
breathed on the blade he’s going into you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He panted on to the blade like a hound getting breath,
then he made a sudden dart, missed by about a foot, and
then followed with dreadful speed and certainty round and
round the yard. The fire, wherever it was, burned up with
a brighter blaze to light him. Hi aimed to reach the door
into the municipal building, but the man was too close
behind him for him to try to open it. He slipped on the
concrete, caught one of the pillars which held the pent-house
roof, and swung round it with such force that he
struck Kezia from behind. The rush and excitement
seemed to steady Kezia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha,” he said, “ain’t this fun? Ain’t this nice hide
and seek? And I’ll bleed you into veal in the drain;
white meat; eightpence a pound, prime cuts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here there came a crash. Perhaps the brightness of
the fire had been fed for the past twenty minutes by the
timbers and rafters of the roof. These now suddenly gave
way and launched the blaze into the pit of the wreck; the
glare of the burning died at once from about them. Hi
was in the dark, poised behind a pillar, trying to see
the drunkard, who was near the desired door. There was
silence for about thirty seconds, each was trying to see the
other; at last the drunkard spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, brother,” he said, “will you shake hands and let’s
be friends?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t shake hands,” Hi said, “when you’ve got a
knife in your hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The knife’s nothing. I took the knife out to cut you
a nice nosegay from all these pretty little bloody roses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was kind of you,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I love you,” the man said; “you are like a lovely little
angel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am, rather,” Hi said. The darkness of the man
seemed to edge a shade nearer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I love angels,” the man said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I always loved angels,” the man said, “since a boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stick to them,” Hi said; “you can’t do better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You blasted young swine,” the man screamed, making
a rush. “I’ll cut your gall and your milt and your
pancridge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi had expected the rush; he slipped to the left as it
surged out at him. The man had expected this movement;
he slashed out sideways with his knife, but missed.
He was after Hi on the instant, roaring, as he rushed, his
war cry of “Harrar.” Hi twisted sharp to his right; the
man followed, he seemed horribly near. Hi heard a splash,
followed by an oath, and a fall; the man had put a foot
into the drain and fallen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi fled to the door into the hall, where he paused; the
man had not risen; he was lying in a heap in the well or
drain, muttering oaths. The fall may have hurt him: it
had certainly knocked the fight out of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you come and give me a hand up?” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Lord, my leg’s broke, man; I can’t hurt you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rats.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God, man; I’d not leave you, if you’d got a broken
leg.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The bone’s coming through the calf of me leg; I’m
just bleeding away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi did not answer this; the man went on:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s pretty poor goods,” he said, “when an Englishman
will leave another Englishman to rot in agony. Oh,
the torment, it’s awful. I feel it corrupting the blood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi was touched by the man’s moans, but did not answer.
The man groaned some more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Young fellow,” he said, “if I die, and I am dying,
you’ll take my love to my poor mother? Mrs. Jones, her
name is. She lives at No. 27, Cowpop Street, Sale,
Cheshire. It’s the only house in the street with a brass
knocker. Say my last thought was of her. And I want
you to sing “Rock of Ages” over my tomb. It’s cruel to die
in a foreign land, but I’d rest better after “Rock of Ages”.
Won’t you come and just hold my head up; I can’t
breathe; there’s darkness coming. Lift me; won’t you
lift me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I won’t,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You young swine,” the man said; “it’s lucky for you
you didn’t, for if you had, I’d have settled you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi went through the door and bolted it behind him. He
tiptoed swiftly along the passage to the corridor down
which the Indians had dragged him. The corridor
stretched right and left along the length of the house. Hi
could make out a staircase, the blackness of doors, and light
in one place from a half-opened door. Hi listened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All was silent at first. Then from somewhere upstairs
he heard the noise of stealthy footsteps, moving slowly.
To his right, from time to time, there was a little light
fluttering noise, as though the wind were stirring an ill-fitting
shutter or loosened jalousie. The man in the prison
yard was quiet. The smell of tobacco smoke shewed that
the other prisoner had passed that way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi went quietly to the half-opened door, listened there,
heard nothing suspicious, and peeped in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room was lit by an oil-lamp which had been turned
so low that it stank. He could not see far into the room.
From within there came again the fluttering noise, which
was now not quite that of a shutter, but liker the yielding
of paper under pressure, as though someone were opening
a book and pressing the pages down so that it should remain
open at the place. It gave Hi the sense that some industrious
old man was working there in the half darkness
gumming papers together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pushed the door very gently till he could see that the
room was a kind of board-room, with shuttered windows.
The table, from which the chairs had been flung back, was
littered with papers. A big picture, partly out of its
frame, was hanging askew on the wall to the right. Nobody
was to be seen; but the noise of the pressed papers came
from somewhere on the floor beyond the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi thought, “It is rats gnawing papers,” but on coming
into the room he saw that it was a dead man beset by
myriads of cockroaches. The man’s pockets had been
turned inside out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi suddenly whirled about in terror: someone was at
his elbow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw at once that he had no need to be terrified; it
was the little man who had opened the prison door. He had
stolen up in his silent way. He grinned at having scared
Hi.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t ’ear me, did yer, cocky?” he said. “Seen the
stiff? They done him in and gone through him; grizzled
party; one of these Digos. We’d better ’op it arter ’ere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi noticed that the man was carrying a long heavy
ebony ruler which had been a part of the office equipment.
He had the feeling that this was the man who had turned
out the dead man’s pockets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bleedin’ old beano goin’ on down the boulevard,” the
man said; “kind of a Brock’s benefit. If they come on
’ere agine, the goin’ won’t ’elp us; we shan’t ’alf ’ave all
right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He led the way out of the room and so away towards
the front door, from which fresh air was blowing into the
house. On the top step a great yellow pariah dog stood,
longing to enter, but scared by their approach. He snarled
and slunk away from them as they came out into the open.
Moved by the thought that the dog might eat the body, Hi
closed the door behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That part of the town was empty of life, except for the
moths about the globe of the electric light. The houses
were shuttered and seemed to be deserted; but Hi saw
that a great disorder had raged there since he had been
thrust into the prison. Household gear of many kinds had
been dragged into the street and left. Far away down the
hill was the glow of the shell of the mansion, each window
red as a furnace mouth. All the inhabitants, as well as the
lancers, seemed to be at the fire, except a few who came
thence quietly with sidelong glances, having pickings from
the wreck under their cloaks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m goin’ to ’op it arter ’ere,” the man said. “No ’ot
potitoes in mine. Coo lummy, what’s that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the back of the city hall, from the direction of the
prison yard, there came a sound of song, mixed with the
tolling of a cuckoo. Henery Peach Kezia was lapping
himself in soft Lydian airs:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the drunkard,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The stiff? You woke him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi noticed that the man’s eyes were fixed upon him
somewhat strangely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which way you goin’, cocky?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anselmo,” Hi said. “Do you know it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it well,” the man said. “I don’t mind setting
you there, or on the way there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s very kind of you,” Hi said. “But are you
going that way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never you mind where I’m going,” the man said.
“You’re a damn sight too nosy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No more nosy, as you call it, than you,” Hi answered.
“I know the way to Anselmo; if it’s out of your own way,
I can find it myself. But we’d better not go straight past
the fire; we might be recognised.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come along ’ere, cocky,” the man said. “If we go
along this road a piece, we can easy cut across later.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They turned up a road which opened to the north not
far from the city hall. The houses near it were small
adobe bungalows, with roofs of red tiles. The stars in the
heaven shone like lamps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, look at the stars,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you being pleasant?” the man asked. “You’re
doing ‘Oh, the starlight’; but they’re cocky little bleeders,
stars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They walked on together for a minute, till they were in
the midst of a grove, where a night singing bird was making
a plaintive, exquisite haunting call. The man paused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was the nime of the plice you was goin’ to?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anselmo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anselmo, that was it; Anselmo.” He seemed to
think for an instant. “Well, there’s no plice of that nime
anywheres abaht ’ere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you said you knew it,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was the nime agine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anselmo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Anselmo,” the man said, “the plice you see over
there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; over there,” Hi said, turning to point. Some
instinct told him to look out, but it came a fraction of a
second too late. He never knew certainly what happened
next, because he was knocked unconscious by a blow on
the point of his jaw, which ended the world for him for four
minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he came to himself, with a dizzy head full of confusion,
he tried to stand, but found that his feet hurt.
Groping down to find out why, he found that his shoes
were gone. Instead of them, a pair of old white deck shoes,
with rubber soles, lay beside him in the track. Then
a certain slackness at his waist seemed unaccustomed.
He put his hand to his waist and found that his money
belt was gone; then he found that his pockets had been
searched: he had been robbed. He called aloud at this.
Then he looked about for his companion, whom he at once
judged to be the thief. There was neither sight nor sound
of him. He had vanished into the night where he belonged.
There was no sound of anyone running, no noise of steps,
nor of bushes being thrust aside. The bird was still making
a plaintive call in the tree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t think what has happened,” Hi said. He sat
down to try to compose himself. When he began to know
that he had been knocked out, he wondered, “for how
long?” The stars had not changed position much, so
far as he could see, and there was still some warmth or so
he thought in the toes of the shoes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He knocked me out and robbed me,” he thought.
“I’d gladly have gone halves with him. I don’t know
what the deuce to do now. Well, I must get to Anselmo,
that’s the first thing. And it must be nearly midnight by
this time and I’m further from Anselmo than I was when
I started.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put on the deck shoes. There was a meanness in
the theft of his shoes which hurt him more even than the
loss of his precious pocket-book with the sprig of hermosita.
When he had put on the shoes and felt their discomforts,
as well as their kind, which was specially loathsome to
him, he walked back to the town, he could not afterwards
tell why. He had no very clear thought of what he was
doing nor of what he ought to do, for the brains were still
shaky in his head from the knock upon his jaw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he turned into the street in front of the city hall,
he saw some of the lancers, followed by a mob, riding uphill
towards him. He turned uphill away from them, till
he was out of the town, in a rocky path near a pine wood.
The lancers paused at the city hall, as though to bivouac.
Hi felt a deadly weariness overcoming the need of reaching
Anselmo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am done,” he thought. “I have done nothing, but
I have been through a good deal to-day. I must rest for
a bit before I go on.” He was cold as well as weary, for
the cold sea breeze was blowing. “It must be midnight,”
he thought. “I will rest for just an hour among those
rocks. If I had only not spoken to that officer at La Boca,
I would have been fifty miles on beyond Anselmo by this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was so stupid from fatigue and the blow that he paid
little heed to his going, as he pushed through the scrub
towards what looked like shelter. Suddenly he caught
a whiff of scent, a rustle of movement and a gleam of
something: he was aware that people were hiding there.
A startled somebody, speaking intensely, in a hiss of
anxiety, said “Padre? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. padre mio?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not the man,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Immediately somebody surged out of the darkness, flung
him down and got him by the throat. He realised at once
that he was in the hands of someone much stronger than
himself, who could break his neck at will, if he made a
noise. Some years before, at the Old Berks Steeplechases,
he had seen a welsher caught by the crowd. When overtaken,
the man had fallen and lain perfectly still, as though
dead; this came back to Hi on the instant as wise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man who had grappled him got him well by the throat
with one hand, while he reached back for his knife with
the other. Hi saw a darkness of face staring into his, and
beyond it pine boughs and stars. Other people were there:
he smelt the scent of verbena: a woman’s voice gave a
caution. A woman seemed to be trying to open a box of
matches and to take out a match: her fingers fumbled on
the matches and people whispered. A man who came
hurriedly from among the rocks struck a match upon his
trouser leg, screened and held it down. Hi saw a lot of
faces staring with surprise at him. He counted four
persons: an old woman with white hair, a girl with great
black eyes, a man with a somewhat finicky pale face, like
the Aztec in the waxworks (he was the one who held the
match), and a swarthy, fierce, very splendid-looking young
man who had him by the throat. Hi noticed the muscles
in the clear brown flesh of the arms which held him.
“Golly,” he thought, “this man could tear a pack of cards
across.” At this instant the match went out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all right,” Hi said. “I’m English.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Inglis,” they repeated. The younger of the two
women asked him in halting English: “What you doing
here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi felt inclined to ask them what they were doing there,
four civilised people, with jewels and scents, in the wilderness
at midnight, garrotting strangers. He said that he
was going to Anselmo and that he had been robbed. They
seemed to understand a part of what he said, but they
were puzzled by it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man, who was holding him, allowed him to sit up
and said something in apology for having been so rough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are they doing in the city?” the young woman
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are plundering and robbing, Señorita,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this instant some horses were heard trotting near to
the pine clump. The man, who had held Hi, signed to him
to remain still, while he stole away through the scrub to
see who came. In a few minutes he returned with the
riders of the horses, one of whom carried a lantern. This
man was a swarthy, bearded, elderly don, more than sixty
years of age, but still lean and alert. His face was both
hard and melancholy, with something of watchfulness
stamped on it by a life passed upon a frontier. He held
up the lantern to examine Hi, while the others repeated to
him Hi’s story of Anselmo, which he did not seem altogether
to accept. “Allan Winter said there was a feeling against
us,” Hi thought. “Now here it is.” He debated whether
he should tell them that he was a White, going on a White
errand. “It might be all right,” he thought. “But
supposing it were all wrong. Supposing these people were
really Reds. Then I should be in a fine mess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The family drew aside to debate what should be done.
Presently the daughter left the group and explained to Hi
that they had to ride to safety, that they did not doubt his
good faith, but that their lives depended on leaving no
witness of their going and that, in short, Hi must come
with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are most sad to ask it,” she said, “but it is for our
mother and sister. You see, this is war. They might
kill us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We not take you far,” the young man said. “We set
you on your journey, when we get to friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was something good-natured and well-bred about
the young man which won Hi, who was, in any case, too
utterly weary to protest. He said he understood and
would gladly do as they asked. The girl and the young
man said that it was very nice of him to take it like that.
They mounted him on one of their spare horses, and set off
together, through a woodland track, which set, for a while,
to the south, and then curved west. Hi watched the
direction as well as he could by the stars, so as to keep his
bearings clear. About north-north-west was his course, he
judged. “Now here I am going south,” he thought.
“The Lord alone knows when I shall get to Anselmo.”
He fell asleep on his horse and knew nothing more of his
journey till he was wakened by the horses stopping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw that they had reached a point in the hill from
which, looking down a ravine, they could see far below
them the lights of the town and the glowing of the burnt
house. The night wind had roused up the flames on the last
of the wreck so that it made a beacon still. The riders
were staring at this, all strangely moved. The two women
were sobbing: the men were muttering curses, or prayers
that were of the nature of curses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, the accursed, the accursed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For all this they shall pay sevenfold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You saints that bear the sword grant me the sword
that I may smite these accursed ones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is their home,” Hi thought, “where all their past
lies burnt. They were chased out of it and then it was
fired.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The father interrupted the scene by saying, “It suffices.
To-morrow is a new day: let us get to-morrow.” He took
his wife’s rein and led the way on, the others followed him.
Hi heard the nice young man say something to him, but he
was too heavy with sleep to know what it was or to answer.
He fell asleep again upon his horse. The high southern
saddle kept him in his seat; sometimes he joggled forwards,
sometimes backwards, while the horse went quietly
on with the others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At about two o’clock in the morning they came to a
ranch which was guarded by mounted men. Here they all
dismounted and went indoors (Hi with them) to what
seemed to be a gathering of the clan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a long room, lit by electric light, like all the
houses in those hills even at that early age. There was
a fire at one end of the room, for the night was cold enough.
A maid of enormous strength, with a fine, square, good-humoured
face, was making or dispensing maté among the
gathering. There were perhaps forty men there, most of
them talking at once, yet the room was so big that they did
not crowd it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the party entered the room, the girl with the verbena
scent noticed how weary Hi was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are tired,” she said. “Enrique, this gentleman
is weary. Anton, get him a maté.” (Enrique was the
Aztec; Anton the nice one.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down,” she said, showing a seat which ran round
the wall. “Anton will bring you a maté.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You sit,” he said. “Let me bring you a maté.”
Anton shoved him down on to his seat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our guests do not wait, they are waited on,” he said.
“You are not a Red, I am sure, to rob us of the last of all
our pleasures.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am a White,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a White?” the girl said. “But we thought
all you English were Reds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m a heretic, of course,” Hi said, “but a White.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anton brought him a maté, which revived him. He
saw the Aztec step into the midst of the gathering call for
silence, and begin a long harangue, with many gestures.
The babble of his voice, the heat of the room and more than
twenty-four hours of strain together made him fall asleep
with the bombilla in his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This falling asleep may be said to mark the end of the
first day of Hi’s going to warn Don Manuel. His going
had not prospered, mainly because one of Don Lopez’
chief supporters, the half-breed Don Livio, a man of
vengeful temper, had detached some lancers to burn the
mansion of the Ribotes, who had had the misfortune to be
the lords in the village in which he had passed his
youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This act of private vengeance brought the lancers across
Hi’s path at the wrong time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While Hi was being checked by event after event, on
this first day, Ezekiel Rust was riding to the west with his
message. At the very moment, when Hi was falling
asleep, Ezekiel Rust was rousing from his rest eighty miles
away to begin his second day’s ride.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch10'>X</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>H</span>i</span> may have slept for half an hour, when he was
wakened by the tinkle of his bombilla falling on
the floor. He roused up as a big, elderly rogue-bull
of a man, with bloodshot eyes and a heavy ruminating
mouth, which seemed to be chewing the cud of fifty different
plans, came in, to take charge of the gathering. Plainly
all there looked up to him as a leader. A flock of talkers
surged up to him with a gabble of explanation and
persuasion: some of it very hot, Hi thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently, Hi found this man staring at him, though as
yet without comprehension. His eyes were fixed on Hi
while his lower lip moved in and out under the strain of
thought. After a time, his bull-like brain began to notice
that Hi was a stranger in the camp: he turned to a man,
indicated Hi by a jerk of the head, and asked, “Who is
that?” Then, turning to Hi, whom of course he knew to
be English, he jerked with his head, saying, “Come here,
you. What are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anton explained as Hi came forward; Hi heard the
words “caballero ingles”: then Anton, after asking his
name, introduced him to Don Pablo something of Meruel.
Hi was refreshed by his sleep and eager to be doing. He
made up his mind that as these were Whites he would tell
his tale, so he did. He said that he was going on urgent
White business to Don Manuel at Encinitas; he asked for
a horse that he might proceed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had said his say, he knew that he had said
something wrong. “I believe they are Reds, after all,” he
thought. “Now I’ve put my foot in it.” Anton drew
him aside a moment and explained: “All the Whites here
are anti-clerical, they hate Don Manuel like poison. You
have said, ‘I take nice Luteran message to the Pope.’ ”
Anton seemed to think it very funny, but Hi was appalled.
“I’ve done for myself now,” he thought, “they’ll probably
jail me for a week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Business with Don Manuel at Encinitas?” Don Pablo
repeated. “And what business?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To tell him that the Reds have put Señorita de Leyva
into prison.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was news to the assembly, but on the whole pleasant
news: the de Leyvas were blamed for most of the troubles
which had fallen on the Whites.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At least,” Don Pablo said, “you cannot reach Don
Manuel from here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to,” Hi said. “I want to reach Anselmo
from here, and from there go on to Don Manuel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very pretty,” Don Pablo said. “There are telegraphs
in Anselmo. You could warn Santa Barbara of all that
has been said here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir,” Hi said, “unfortunately, I know no Spanish,
and have not understood what has been said here: besides,
I am not a spy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are the first to mention the word,” Don Pablo
answered. “You are here, we are here, the trouble
exists, the telegraph exists, Santa Barbara exists. I
consider the situation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir,” Hi said, “but I have been only four nights
in this land, I know nothing of your politics.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How comes it then,” Don Pablo interrupted, “that
you go at all upon this errand? Why are you sent? Who
sent you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must not tell you that, sir,” Hi answered, “but I was
sent because the need was great, and because an Englishman
will not be suspected by the Reds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very true,” Don Pablo answered, “but he may be
suspected by the Whites. See you,” he added, turning to
address the assembly in Spanish, “this boy may justly be
suspected by us, when he comes from we know not where
and says that he wishes to reach Anselmo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As most of those there were like water, ready to flow in
any direction opened to it, as long as it were downhill, this
turned the company against Hi. They agreed that he
might justly be suspected. Why should he be there, they
asked, if he wished to reach Anselmo? This was now war;
Anselmo was a place of the Reds undoubtedly; this was an
English boy; that he should be sent on a message was
a farce. Undoubtedly he was a spy or might be used as
a spy. Hi did not know their words, but their meanings
were plain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may be this or you may be that,” Don Pablo said,
in English, “but you cannot go to Anselmo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, sir, I must go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What say you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir, I must go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Don Pablo pretended to be deaf, he held one of his ears
with his hand, so as to catch the sound: the company
tittered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What say you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir, I must go to Anselmo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah,” Don Pablo said with a smile, turning to the men,
“He says that he must go to Anselmo. <span class='it'>Must go</span>; this
very important English word. No, sir,” he said, turning
to Hi, “you may go to your Reds in Carpinteria, or you
may go home to your English in England; no one shall
stop you; it is a healthy walk, for you English are accustomed
to walk; but you shall not go to Anselmo. You
shall not go to Anselmo, because it is a special place, which
I am determined that you shall not see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His face, as he spoke, became gorged with blood like the
wattles of a turkey cock. Having settled Hi, as he judged,
he turned to the assembled men and made them a long
harangue in Spanish. Long afterwards Hi learned that
the purpose of the meeting was to keep the Pituba raiders
out of that part of Meruel. The men there were Whites,
but anti-clerical and, on the whole, in favour of Lopez,
because he was a Meruel man. Pablo’s purpose, at that
moment, was to get the party to ride to a well-known
ranch to get from it the reinforcement of its company.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All there seemed pleased at his suggestion, except those
whose mansion had been burned in Ribote. These retired
in a group in some indignation when the others left the
room. Hi was left alone in the great room, save for the
broad, good-humoured maid, who was gathering up the
bombillas. She was a friendly soul; she made remarks in
Spanish to Hi, so that he might feel at ease.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Many bombillas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Si,” Hi answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better many guests than many locusts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was beyond Hi, who grinned. After a little time,
she added, with a sigh:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are more guests than lovers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi did not know what she said, but he answered, in
English, “Such is life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After some twenty minutes of talking outside the house
the assembled men mounted their horses, which had been
kicking and snapping at each other, from anger at the cold,
through all the hours of the discussion. Even when they
had mounted they made no effort to start. They continued
to discuss till it was broad daylight, when they all
set off together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anton entered with his sister. He came up to Hi to
apologise for Don Pablo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is absurd,” he said, “that that man should have
stopped your going to Anselmo. There is no reason why
you shouldn’t go to Anselmo. Of course you may go
there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no horse,” Hi said. “Would you lend me a
horse so that I could go there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know the way?” the girl asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must be forty kilometres and a difficult way except
through Ribote.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could find it,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The brother and sister looked at each other with some
hesitation. Hi was afraid that they were wondering
whether to trust a tramp, who came at midnight, with
neither collar nor tie, from God knows where.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry to say,” he said, “that I have got no money
with me, but Mr. Winter, of Quezon, beyond Santa Barbara,
knows me, and Señora Piranha and her daughter know me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rosa Piranha?” the girl said. “You know her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well. Do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were at the convent together,” the girl said. “Of
course we will lend you a horse. What is your name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ridden. Will you tell me yours?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are Ribotes,” she said. “But what makes us
consider is, the road to Anselmo. It is no road, my brother
says.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a bad road,” Anton said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t mind how bad it is as long as it is a road,” he
said. “And I’ll not let your horse down or give him a
sore back or anything; I swear I won’t. And I don’t know
how to thank you for saying you will lend me one. The
point is, getting him back to you. I’m going to the Elenas,
the horse-breeders, of Anselmo; I am sure they would
send him back or I would bring him back myself, if you
would not mind waiting a few days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bring him back yourself,” Anton said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes,” the girl said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The horse will be all right,” Anton said, “but how about
the rider? First you must have food.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They gave him sausage, bread, coffee and figs. Then
they filled saddle-bags with these things and with corn for
him to take with him. Anton brought him a silk scarf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will want this for your neck,” he said. “There
will be ticks or mosquitoes in the forest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No doubt they would have given him money, had they
not feared to hurt his feelings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know how to thank you two,” he said. “You
have been most frightfully kind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The least we could do,” Anton said, “after nearly
murdering you in the dark, as I did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They brought him out to the stables, where they saddled
a horse for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He will take you to Anselmo all right,” Anton said.
“The question is, will you be able to find your way there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will try,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so easy,” Anton said. “Look there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From where he stood Hi could see nothing but great
swathes of rolling forest, amid a mist that was lifting and
falling as though it were alive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see that it is not easy,” Anton said, “even when
you get out of the forest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I’ll find it all right,” Hi said. “I’m good at
finding my way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anton pursed up his lips and shook his head. “I hope,”
he said, “I hope. You got good remembrance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good. Then I tell you all the way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right. I’ll remember.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is difficult,” Anton said. “You follow this track
here for three kilometres, through the scrub. Then you
come to a place very big as a saucer; big, big. Then north-west
across it to a hole, snap, cut off, like so, in the hills, a
long way, fifteen kilometres. Out there you will see peones
who ride. One will show you. You must not go so, no;
but so, because, so, there is no ground; all is gone. But
this not for twenty kilometres. Till then, you look for the
place big as a pan, very big; and the hill that has like so;
high, yet so, snap, see; no, more like so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was not clear as a course should be, but his gestures
made it clearer. Anton knew the dangers of losing a trail;
he turned to his sister for an English rendering of what he
wished to explain. Unfortunately she had not seen the
place which he strove to describe, nor was her English
much better than his, but she added a few words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After this track,” she said, “there is a .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. very big.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A lake?” Hi suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A water?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, no; very big dry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I understand. A dry valley?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Si, si. Then you cross this; oh, it is long. Then you
look a way out. There is a hole in the hill, like so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A pass?” Hi said. “A gap? A way to go
through?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Si, si.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” Anton said, “you must not go to this side, right
side, because no ground; go to left side. Ask peones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will there be peones?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Always peones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if I cannot find a peon to ask?” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bad, bad,” Anton said. “A difficult way. Not for
some kilometres. But keep north through the path
through the forest; see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anselmo is north from the pass,” the girl said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll find it,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Si, si, you will find it. It is narrow road in the forest;
but to the left. Then you get out of the forest you will see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi was well used to finding his way on the downs; he
had plenty of confidence in himself. “I’ll find it,” he
repeated. “But one thing more; if any people stop me,
may I say that I come from you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They will see that you come from us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The brand,” Anton said, pointing to two wavy marks,
one above the other, on the horse’s quarter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you again,” Hi said, “for all that you have done
for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good luck,” the girl said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come tell us how you got on,” Anton said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will, indeed, if I may. Thank you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His horse was one of the rather small, sturdy, savannah
ranch horses, bred in the uplands from the descendants
of the conquerors’ mares by the stallions imported from
England. He was dark, wise and full of go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will he buck?” Hi asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you meet a tiger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If a pig, he kick; so you know,” the girl said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right. Thanks. Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Con Dios.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The horse was as eager to be gone as Hi to go. He
sailed sideways down the avenue. Just as he turned into
the thicket, Hi looked back to wave to his friends; they
waved back to him. In two seconds more they were out
of sight; he was riding through forest that was all dropping
dew and trailing mist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am really off at last,” he thought. “Twenty-four
hours late in starting and twice as far from Anselmo as
I was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mist strayed itself out into clearness and the tops
of the trees began to glitter as the sun rose higher. Little
birds came flying just in front of him, as though to show
their speed. Their cries, as they flew, sounded as though
each bird were calling to “go it.” “I’ll go it fast enough,”
he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a long time he heard no other noise than the cries of
these birds and the drumming of the feet of the horse. As
he went on, he caught another noise, which at first he
thought must be the wind in the tree-tops. Then, as it
grew louder, he recognised it as the noise of water. He
came round a curve upon a scene so beautiful that it made
him pull up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came unexpectedly upon a ravine or gash in the hill.
Close to him, on his left side, the hill, which had always
been steep, changed suddenly to crag, over which a brook
was falling in white, delaying mists, for some seven hundred
feet. At the foot of the fall some long distant collapse had
made an undercliff, nearly flat, across which the water
loitered in a broad shallow rock basin, till it reached another
fall. What he had been hearing was the noise of the falls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the ravine and pool made a wide open space, all the
hillside in front of him was in such light that he could see,
for the first time, what colour can be. The timber grew to
great heights beyond the pool, but all the timber down the
glade was heaped and piled with a pouring fire of creeper
in blossom. A white flowered creeper had piled itself like
snow even to the tops of the green-hearts, and fell thence in
streamers and banners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the crags, as well as the rocks of the pool, were of a
pale blue colour, like lapis lazuli. Mists from the falling
water made rainbows all down the cliff. White birds
cruised among the rainbows and changed colour in them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw all this in a few seconds of admiration. Then he
saw that the broad shallow pool was peopled by a priesthood,
in rosy mantles, moving with an exquisite peace along
the water. The leading priest rose into the air silently
and gracefully; the others followed, till all the flight were
moving away, more like flowers or thoughts or dreams than
birds. He watched them till their effortless wings drooped
them to some lower pool out of sight. “Those are the rosy
ibises,” he thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damned pretty birds,” his father had said, “only you
don’t often get a shot at them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rode through the pool to the rising trail beyond;
soon he was in the gloom again, winding up into the hills
among forest. “I must be near the big dry pan or valley,”
he thought. “I hope I haven’t gone wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Almost as he uttered the thought the thickets thinned
to an undergrowth in blossom noisy with bees. A few yards
more brought him out to the “very big dry” of the
savannah, which was unlike anything ever seen by him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His first thought was that it was the crater of a volcano
or the bed of a lake, perhaps twenty miles long by seven
broad. It may well have been both, in turn. Now it was
an expanse of grass ringed by hills. Some eagles were
cruising over it; their majesty suited the vastness of the
expanse. The emptiness and the freedom of the vastness
made Hi catch his breath. He was the king of that space;
there was nothing there but wind and grass, with clumps
of tussock-grass standing out here and there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not take it all in at once; then he thought, “I
was to meet peones here, who will set me on my way. I
see no peones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A searching of the distance showed him, far off, some
specks, some white, some dark. “Those are the herds,”
he thought. “And the peones are with them. How those
white cattle shine in the sun. But they are all miles away
from here. There is none near me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what was it that they said I was to look for? I
was to go ‘north-west across it to a hole, snap, so,’ ten
miles away. Well, let’s have a look. That will be north-west,
roughly. And there, by George, is a sort of snap
in the hills, as though they were cut or broken. That is
the pass he means; that is my way. So let us forward for
there. But what a place, what a land, what a life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a good enough life for a man, to ride that expanse
on a horse worthy of such going. The horse felt the stir of
that freedom. Hi felt him kindle beneath him into the
tireless stride of the horse of the savannah. As he went, his
hoofs drummed up myriads of glittering green beetles which
whirled about them and flew with them, sometimes settling
on horse or man, then whirling on again, now with shrillness,
now with droning, till the noise they made was the
ride itself set to music. “I shall save her,” he sang to the
music, “I shall save Carlotta. And she will marry her
man, of course, but all the same I shall have done that;
and we shall be friends of a special sort all our lives. It
will be something that nobody else will have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He kept headed for the pass, but his eyes roved the land
for a peon. Soon he was startled by the light on the
distance to his left; he had seen nothing like it. All the
things in that southern distance became so distinct that he
felt that he was looking at them through a telescope. At
the same time, the calls of the peones, the beating of their
horses’ hoofs, and the movings of the cattle came to him
from across the miles of the savannah. “It is odd that
things should be so clear,” he thought. “I should say it
means rain.” The tops of the southern hills brightened
till they seemed to spout flames into the sky. These flames
soon changed into streamers of cirrus, less fiery than copper-coloured,
with rose half-way up the heavens. “It is just
as though the sky were feeling bilious,” he thought. With
this change in the heavens, a change came into the air and
into the horse; all the delight of the going went; the
beetles gave up their play. Presently the copper-colour
darkened along the hilltops to something like the smoke of
a burning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s going to be a storm,” Hi thought. “I’d be just
as well in the cover of the pass before it breaks. Come up,
horse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The horse made it clear that he was uneasy about something,
or was in some way feeling Hi’s uneasiness. He had
become nervy and on edge in a way which Hi could not
explain. He himself felt nervy, but the restlessness of his
horse frightened him. “I believe he smells some wild
beast or snakes,” Hi thought; but he could see neither;
there seemed to be no creatures on that llano save some
beasts like tailless rats and a few birds which piped and fled.
The edge of the clouds tattered out into rags which soon
laid hold of the sun so that all the joy died from the
scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re in for a storm and a half,” Hi thought, “one of
those electrical storms my father was always gassing
about.” He took a look to his left, where now the darkness
had blotted out the line of the hills, then he took a look to
his right, where the hills stood in a glow which made them
look like hills in hell. Straight ahead was the gash or pass
by which he was to descend. He could see no cattle nor
peones there. “Perhaps they are in the pass,” he thought,
“in some ranch or corral there. But I hope they are, for
then I may find some shelter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The air had long since lost its zest. It was flat yet
heavy, though both Hi and the horse were sweating, there
was a feeling of death being present, which suggested cold;
all kinds of evil seemed about to happen. Waifs and
strays of thought came into Hi’s mind and went out of it;
he felt that he could not concentrate upon any one of
them. A few drops of rain splashed down, like florins and
half-crowns, with a rattle on the tough grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had made an effort to be in the pass before the storm
broke. He reached it in time but, being there, he found it
grim enough. It was a gash, between two cliffs of rotten
rock, which curved round into a grimmer gash, all black
with a grove of vast trees. “Better under the trees than
in the open,” he thought, so he turned towards the cover.
The noise of the hoofs upon the stones made echoes like
the smacking of nails into a coffin. “That’s got you,
that’s got you,” the smacking seemed to say, “that’s got
you.” He stopped the horse, so that the echoes might
stop. Looking back at the crater over which he had ridden,
he found that he could see little save a greyness out of which
came a sighing. All the place seemed to moan at him with
a moan of despair, that sounded like, “Oh, it’s got us at
last.” Out of the greyness a coldness came suddenly from
the icefields on the mountain. Then the great grassy
expanse disappeared from view. The storm, sweeping up,
shut out the world. “Very little more,” he thought, “and
I should have been caught in the open.” Suddenly streaks
of greyness ran like men along the ground and struck
flashes with their feet. “By George, it’s rain,” he said;
“it’s all rain. This is rain indeed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the instant, the greyness sighed into a hissing, hissed
into a rushing, and rushed into a roaring. It sucked up
all the last of the savannah, surged over the mouth of the
pass, beat Hi breathless and engulfed him, in a roaring of
pouring, as though a river were falling. Hi felt that he
was freezing and that everything else had turned to water:
he was in water and under water, the air he breathed was
water: the earth his horse stood on was running water.
Thunder sounded not far off: he could not see the lightning,
but remembered his father’s stories of iron outcrops
in the rocks near the Meruel border, which seemed to
“attract” any lightning there might be. He did not
know whether iron outcrops could “attract” lightning;
probably it was one of his father’s insane theories, but it
might be the fact, in which case he was near the Meruel
border, and might be standing on the magazine waiting for
the spark. The thought of trying to push on, through the
rain, did not enter his head: he could not see twenty yards
in any direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The violence of the rain lasted for some two hours, after
which it relented to a downpour not worse than that of
steady rain in England. When once it had relented thus,
it steadied, as though it would never cease: it was this
steadiness which daunted Hi. “It’s raining like an eight-day
clock,” Hi thought. “It might keep on at this pace for
days.” He sought to the thickest cover that he could find
and hoped for the best. In another hour, the heavens
descended on him, so that while water streamed from
heaven and forest, the air was a greyness of melting and
moving cloud. All the forest was alive with the rushings,
the laughters and the forebodings of rain falling or being
shaken: sometimes it came at him like the footsteps of
enemies, sometimes like lamentings, anon with a crackle
as though a pack were afoot. “The horse would take me
out of this,” he thought, “but he would take me straight
back to the estancia, so that I should have to start again.
I’d better wait here. After all, if it rains like this it must
rain itself out before long: no clouds could stand it. I
wonder where all the cloud can come from. As soon as
this mist or cloud or fog goes, I’ll push on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having made his plan, he stuck to it: the cloud seemed
to do the same; it did not go: it even increased till the
earth seemed melting and the air liquid. “Golly,” Hi
thought, “this cloud isn’t going to go. I may be here for
days.” He reckoned that he had been there already for
some hours. “I must find some browsing for the horse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This the horse found without going far from where they
were: he led the way to some shrubs, which he ate with
relish. “I hope he knows what is good for him,” Hi
thought, “for I don’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He secured the horse from straying: then he sought
about for a shelter from this never-ceasing drip: there was
no shelter in sight. “Probably there isn’t one anywhere,”
he thought, shuddering. “I shall be here for the day and
night, and goodness knows how much longer besides.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had come back to his horse, partly from fear of losing
him, partly for his company, when the greyness dimmed to
a greater density, so that he could not see his outstretched
hand. In this dimness an eternity passed. The rain
continued unabated. He contrived to tend the horse, and
to give him some of the corn which Anton had provided;
later, when he had watered him, he contrived to tether him
securely near the bushes where he could browse. After
this he himself ate, very sparingly, of the food which Anton
had given. When he had supped, it was dark: the night
had fallen. Hi made himself a nest of unease in the
edible bush, which smelt like his mother’s tooth-powder.
Lying on a mess of trampled boughs, which kept him off
the mud, he crouched himself into a ball till something like
warmth came into him; then he even slept a little, in
starts and nightmares, from which he would leap up,
terrified that the horse had gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was his second night upon the road to fetch Don
Manuel. At about the time when he lay down upon his
boughs Ezekiel Rust, dead beat, pulled up somewhere in
sight of the lights of San Jacinto city, at the other end of
the Central Province. Out there in the barrens, the old
man was comforting his horse, before lying down in the
sage with a rope round him to keep off the snakes. He
had had such a ride as he had never dreamed of; but being
soft to the saddle, after some years in a town, he could go
no further without a rest.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch11'>XI</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>S</span>ome</span> hours after midnight, Hi woke aching with
cramps and dripping with sweat: it was oppressively
hot and still: all the forest was holding its breath, as
though about to do something dreadful. There was a
deliberation, even about the droppings from the trees.
“Golly,” Hi thought, “it feels as though the earth were
going to open.” It was pitch dark in the forest: the mist
had gone from the trees, yet there was no glimmer of any
star: the moon, being young, was long since gone. The
stew of air gave Hi the feeling that a heaven of cast-iron
was descending bodily upon the tree-tops to squeeze the
earth flat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The suspense of waiting for the heaven to fall was
broken suddenly by thunder, rain and wind, all rising in
violence until, at about an hour after dawn, they reached
a pitch such as Hi had not believed to be possible. Then,
while the forest was crashing with falling boughs and trees,
and the air all vehement water and flying fragments, the
heart suddenly went out of the storm; the darkness from
above rolled away to leeward, showing the sun. The wind,
which had been a thing of death, at once became a thing of
healing: the storm was over: nature was freed from
prison: Hi could go on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could go on; but he had lost another complete day
and the going was changed. He was in a world of mud like
the first chaos. All the wood was littered with thousands
of young leaves, twigs and caterpillars. The millioned
life, which had thrust at the first rains, had been washed
to a smalm by these last. The ground of the wood had
been so worked by the rain that it looked and trod like a
ploughed field in a wet November. He rode out of the
wood, all streaming as he was, towards the gulley of the
pass. For one glorious minute, he saw all things glitter in
the sun: the warmth beat upon him like life itself; then
the rain began again: not heavy rain, but a steady trickle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time, he was in the ravine of the pass into which
every gulley, meuse and cranny, as well as the gashes cut
by the storm, had been draining for many hours. A mess
as of a dozen ploughed fields, of different colours of clay,
had been washed into the pass, plastered there and
sprinkled with boulders. Here and there boulders too big
to shift had stood as obstructions to the floods. Near
these, small boulders and ridges of rotten stone had been
washed or flung so as to form moraines or dams across the
hollow of the valley. Sometimes these dams held pools of
water many feet in depth. All the pass rang with the
noise of falling water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went on, cold and soaked; on foot in the mud, leading
a miserable horse through pools, morasses and over stones.
The rain fell steadily, and there was no road nor signpost,
nothing but the direction of the gulley down the hill, the
noise of water, sometimes birds, but never beast nor man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the worse of it is,” he thought, “that I must be
coming to that place where I was to turn off, if I was to
turn off. That was what he meant, I think: that I had to
go to the left of a crossing. I only hope that it will clear
before I reach the place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It did not clear: it went on raining.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is what father meant,” he thought, “when he
said, ‘You’ll thank me before the year’s out for sending
you to a land of the sun.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wondered much into what kind of country he had
come, for he could see so little, except the faces of rocks
all streaming, then mist, then folds of hill, from which
streamers of rain came out and passed. Presently he came
to trees which had hard leaves that clacked: his teeth
clacked in sympathy. Not long after this, he came to a
bridge, not over but in a torrent; and here he had to
blindfold his horse to get him across. On the other side
of the bridge, at a little distance above the waters, was a
stone with an inscription in Latin:</p>

<div class='lgc' style='margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>Pray for the souls</p>
<p class='line'>Of Espinar, Gamarro, Velarde.</p>
<p class='line'>Drowned here.</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>He wondered as he looked back at the bridge, with the
water swirling across it between the balusters of the
parapets, how he had ever crossed. He patted his horse
“for being such a sport.” He judged that this river must
be the upper waters of the river at La Boca; but any sense
of direction was long since gone from him: he did not
know where he was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Memory of his friend’s direction, that there was no road
to the right, made him edge to his left, whenever there was
an opening. He was not on any track or trail now, but
in mud or scrub among the clouds; sometimes rocks
loomed out at him, sometimes trees. When he halted, as
he sometimes did, to shout, in the hope of an answer, he
had no answer, save the noise of the rain that wept as
though all hope were gone. “Well, if I go on, I must
reach somewhere,” he said. “I can’t go back, even if I
wanted to, because the river’s rising, and nothing would
take me over that bridge again, with the water worse than
it was. One good thing about this rain is, that there won’t
be any forest fever yet, since the rains aren’t at an end.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was consolation of a kind; but he was as sick and
shaking from cold and misery as most fevers could have
made him. He noticed after a time that he was going uphill
again. After some hours of this he came into a forest
of giant trees. There was no undergrowth and little light
in this forest. He rode in a gloom full of sighing like
voices and full of dropping like footsteps. The rain seeped
in films and streaks through this wood: mists of it paused
in places, like ghosts looking at him from behind trees.
Sudden gusts sent rushes of water to the ground with the
noise of the steps of beasts. It was in this wood that the
rain began to slacken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first, he thought that this was only a seeming, due to
the shelter of the trees; but soon the mists of the rain
cleared from the boles, which at once became like gods for
bulk and silence. Soon the birds and insects reappeared;
ants came to forage among what the rain had brought to
earth; ticks fell from the trees; the big red and yellow
fungi at the tree roots unrolled themselves into enormous
spiders which waved their front legs at Hi in a terrifying
rhythm, as though they were trying to hypnotise him.
They did it slowly, with their eyes fixed upon him. They
seemed to be repeating:</p>

<div class='lgc' style='margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>Fee, Fi, Fo, Fum,</p>
<p class='line'>I smell the blood of an Englishman.</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>Hi could see no tracks anywhere on that wet earth, but he
realised that his horse was leading him somewhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good old boy,” he said, “you know more about these
parts than I do. If you can bring me to any comfort I’ll
be grateful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A long time passed before comfort appeared. It came
with the brightening of the light in the gaps among the
tree-tops: the very sight of this was warmth to him. “The
sun,” he said, “I’ll do it yet, if I can only find someone to
direct me.” The horse went straight ahead till at about
two in the afternoon, as Hi guessed, he paused and
whinnied, and horses whinnied in reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There, at a little distance in front of him, on a level
patch, where the trees, being small, had been easily cleared,
was a hut or shack with smoke rising from the chimney.
It was a white man’s, not an Indian’s hut, because it was
sided and ended with unbarked planks and roofed with
shingles. It was old and falling to pieces. It must have
been deserted for years, Hi thought, yet smoke was rising
from it. Beside it was a long, ruinous pent-house or shed,
with a torn canvas crib or manger running along its wall.
“I suppose it is an outlying camp,” Hi thought, “or some
old winter house for the timber cutters; anyhow, thank
Heaven, there are people there.” He could see two pale
faces peering round the half-opened door at him. When
he lifted his eyes from the house, he saw, at a little distance,
two tethered horses pausing from their grass to stare at
him. As he advanced from his halting place, the faces at
the door moved forward, so that he could make out a man
and a woman. The man advanced to a pace beyond the
door. He was a short, fresh-coloured man, with fair hair,
and a small sandy moustache. What Hi noticed more
particularly was that the man looked guilty, as though he
had been caught in the act of something. “He’s scared
at something,” Hi thought. When the man saw that Hi
was only a boy, a relief came over his face, a relief so great
that it made him laugh unpleasantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman had drawn back out of sight inside the shed,
where (from the sound) she seemed to be doing something
with bedclothes, making a bed or packing something in
blankets. Hi thought: “There’s something fishy here.
I’ve caught them in the act at something. And it must
be pretty bad or he wouldn’t be in such a funk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is this the way to Anselmo?” Hi asked. The man
looked blank. Hi repeated the question, more than once;
after a while the woman came to the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anselmo?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Si, si, Anselmo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Por aqui, Anselmo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was a willowy woman, all slink and gleam, with a
speck in one eye and something swollen in lip and nose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is, then, the way to Anselmo,” Hi said. “La
via a Anselmo? The calle or route a l’Anselmo?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Si, si,” the woman said, nodding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first wish of the couple, to get the stranger away
from the hut, without letting him peep inside, now changed
to another wish: a strange look passed between them,
which made Hi uneasy. The man had enormous fore-arm
muscles: his right fore-arm had been bruised or scraped
quite recently. In his trousers he had a gun pocket which
plainly had been used for a gun, though no gun was there at
the moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Por aqui, Anselmo,” the man said, taking Hi’s bridle
and turning the horse away from the shack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He show you,” the woman said in English.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it far to Anselmo?” Hi asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man said he could not understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t understand, either,” Hi thought, “what you
two have been up to, here in the forest. You aren’t living
here; you only came here an hour ago; because there are
no tracks to the door, except brand new ones. Why do you
two come here in the rains to pack something in blankets?
What were you packing in blankets?” What indeed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man led him past the two tethered horses into the
forest on the trail by which the horses had come there an
hour or so before. Hi had noticed horse tracks ever since
he was a child: he noticed suddenly the tracks of a third
horse in the soft earth. Three horses had come towards
the shack that morning: the third had gone off suddenly
into the forest. Why?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man led on, saying nothing, but thinking the more.
Glancing back, Hi saw the woman moving from the shack
into the forest. “I wonder if I’m going to be led round
to meet her,” he thought. “And if so, why?” Glancing
forward, Hi saw that the man was looking at him with a
strange expression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe they’re up to no good,” he thought. “I’ll
get out of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment, he did not know how to get out of it, nor
how he could manage without a guide if he did. Then the
certainty that this couple were wicked urged him to act.
Something said in his brain, “Behind that door they had
a lad like you, whom they had murdered.” A picture
formed in his brain of the woman behind the door, rolling
a body in a blanket. Whenever she rolled the body face
up, the face which showed was his own. “It may be all
imagination,” he thought, “but I’ll go on alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He checked the horse, with a sign to the man: he did not
know what on earth he was to do next.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dis donc,” he said in a mixed speech. “Esta Anselmo
loin d’ici? Anselmo .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. sabe? Anselmo, est il bien
loin? La ville d’Anselmo, est il far?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man nodded his head and grinned, as though to
reassure him. Something in the man’s face, the pouchy
look under the eyes, reminded Hi of one of the portraits of
Henry VIII: it looked evil from evil done and evil planning.
The man turned to his path and seemed about to lead the
horse off the trail. “I daresay,” Hi thought, “the woman
is the shot: she has the revolver. He’ll lead me round to
her and she’ll pot me from behind a bush. Yet he’s as
strong as an ox. I can’t hit him or break from him without
getting the worst of it. What can I do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The voice in his brain said, “Scare him”; but he did not
seem to be an easy man to scare. “I could make the horse
shy,” he thought, “though if I do that, I may be bucked
off myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dis donc,” he said again, “sont ils beaucoup de
guardias civiles in Anselmo? Moi, je ne veux pas le police.
Sabe? Comprende Usted? Police? Muchas guardias me
muchas afraido.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man said something in his sullen way that all would
be well, better than well: again he turned to his task,
leading the horse off the trail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Things are getting to be critical,” Hi thought. “I
must try a scare.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was about to try some sudden startling of the horse,
when the woman called out something. The man stopped
and shouted in reply: from the woman’s answer Hi made
out that she wanted the man for some reason, to do something
which she could not do. “Wants him to load the
revolver, probably,” he thought. The man seemed vexed at
the request: he seemed to ask if she could not manage
as she was: she answered “No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man growled in his throat. “Bah. Las mujeres.”
He let go the rein, with a look of threat and misgiving.
He said something to Hi, which seemed to mean: “You
stay here a minute: I’ll be back directly.” He strode off
in the direction from which the woman had called. Hi
let him go about ten yards, then he turned his horse, and
urged him up. The man turned and called out to him
to stop. Glancing back, as the horse got into his stride, Hi
saw the man running back to where the horses were tethered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The brute’s going to chase me,” he thought. “And
he’ll track me, even if I dodge him. The worst of it is,
that I don’t know whether I am headed for Anselmo or the
new Jerusalem; but I must come out somewhere if I keep
on. This forest can’t go on for ever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was true; but he had a memory of his father saying,
“The forest goes all the way to Cualimaçu on the Matulingas,
1,500 miles if its an inch.” If he happened to be
heading for Cualimaçu, his journey to Anselmo was likely
to be protracted. For the moment, however, his thought
was to get away from these people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Almost at once, his horse shied from a pool of blood
where men had trodden within the hour. It was surrounded
by big blue butterflies as greedy for salt as English butterflies
for honey. “That’s where the murder was,” he
thought, “and those two will follow me because they know
that I know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After an hour, however, when he halted for the third
time to listen for the sound of pursuit, he felt sure that
he was not pursued. He rode on slowly through the forest,
leaving the direction to the horse, who now seemed to know
where he was going. As far as he could tell, in the gloom
of under the trees, he went westwards but not directly, for
the thorn thickets forced him now in one direction, now in
another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently the horse cocked his ears at something and
challenged. Hi halted, expecting and fearing to see some
wild beast, but in a few seconds he saw that there was a
horse in front of him, standing still among the tree trunks,
watching him, some fifty yards ahead. He was almost
invisible at first, for a horse will fade into any background
or dimness; as he became distinct, Hi saw that he was
saddled and bridled, though not mounted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is it,” he thought, “the brute has headed me off.
This is the murderer. He has slipped off his horse there,
and is somewhere among the trees waiting to pot me. Even
if I dodge him, there’ll still be Mrs. Now my only chance
is to dodge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was about to dodge, knowing the futility of dodging,
when the horse strode out of his covert into view. He was
a darker horse than the two big sorrels tethered near the
shack. He had a running cut on his side and a saddle
twisted underneath him. He came ramping from his place,
full of power and alarm. “By George, it’s the dead man’s
horse,” Hi cried, “and what a beauty. I’ll have him.”
However, the horse had been terrified once that day;
Hi’s coming set him off again full tilt into the wilderness,
with his stirrups flying from flank to foreleg or swinging
back to clank under his belly. Presently, the girth buckle
broke, the saddle fell and made him stumble, but he
recovered, shook it clear and strode off into the woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon after his stridings had ceased to beat in the ears,
the air above began to sigh with the homings of countless
birds which settled on the trees with cryings and shriekings.
Then suddenly there came a darkening all over the forest,
as though the light had been turned off at a tap. Hi
knew what this meant. His father had often told him
that when the sun went behind Mount Melchior the light
went off, so that you couldn’t see to shoot. “Now here
I am with the day gone,” he thought. “It will soon be dark,
and I have not yet started for Anselmo. Buck up, old horse,
and get me out of the forest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The horse seemed to be bound for somewhere; but after
another hour of going, when it was beginning to be dark, he
was still in the forest. He could see no gleam of open
country nor hear anywhere any noise of men. When he
halted to shout, he had no answer, except the sudden
silence of birds and beasts. He was there in the depths, out
of the reach of his kind, as alone as a man can be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps in the past the horse had had some happiness in
that part of the forest, which led him thither now. When it
was almost too dark to go further, he bore his rider into a
space where Indians had made a cassava patch by burning
off the trees. Indians and cassava shrubs were long since
gone, but the space was still clear of forest. In that
patch of ground, some eighty by fifty yards across, there
was tall grass of a bright yellow colour between two and
three feet high. About this, the trees grew to less than their
usual size, being (as it seemed) bowed down by the weight
of the creepers. Over the patch was the dome or depth
of violet sky in which there were already stars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The horse thrust into the patch and fell to eating greedily.
Hi dismounted to look about him; he found that there
was water at one edge of the patch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d better stay here for the night,” he thought,
“because I’m lost. In the morning perhaps I may be able
to find a way out. If I could only see the sun or Polaris
I would be out in no time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He unsaddled his horse, rubbed him well down with
grass, and having haltered him, hitched him to a tree.
He gathered him some armsfull of the grass, and talked
to him, as he ate, for comfort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All through his ride he had not tasted food, because of
something he had said to himself at breakfast, “I hope my
next meal may be at Anselmo.” Now, when he saw plainly
that he could not reach Anselmo for many hours to come,
he drew his food from his bags. The rain had made a paste
of the bread, but he scraped some of the paste together and
ate it with some sausage; he drank of the water of the pan,
which smacked of the marsh. He reckoned that he still
had one tolerable meal of paste left in his bag, and one
good feed of oats for the horse. These things he resolved
to keep in reserve. Under the paste of the bread he found
five silver pesetas, which Anton or the girl had hidden
for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was much touched by this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But his main feeling was one of overwhelming anxiety for
his friends who were depending on him. “Oh, they must
feel that I have failed them,” he thought. “They must
have sent someone else. If this has happened to ’Zeke as
well, God help Carlotta. God help her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A strange whiteness of light glimmered high up in the
trees: in a few moments it died, leaving all things strangely
dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here is the night,” he thought. “Oh, it is lonely.
This is my third night away and I haven’t even started yet.
But I’ll get my bearings and start at dawn. I’ll get through
somehow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stars deepened overhead: the birds lapsed into
silence: what noises there had been in the wood became
suddenly stealthier. Little bright burnings came and went
in the air as the fireflies began. Hi gathered more grass for
the horse, tried his tether, and then made himself a nest
of grass in which he could not sleep, because of the cold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the morning of this, the third day, of Hi’s journey,
Ezekiel Rust came at a gallop to the house at Encarnacion,
where Don Manuel watched beside the dead body of his
mother. Being admitted to Don Manuel, he delivered his
message, with what news he could add from the underworld
of Medinas. Don Manuel waited for half an hour, while
his mother’s body was buried; then he rode to San Jacinto
city, to intercept any other messenger coming from the
capital. By the early afternoon he was summoning all
his friends and adherents in the Western Provinces to
come with arms, fodder and horses to a rendezvous east
of the river. At about the time when Hi was settling to
his nest, Don Manuel’s first supporter, Pascual Mestas,
came in to the rendezvous with twenty men from Santiago.
Ezekiel Rust was given a bed in the inn at San Jacinto,
with the promise that he should not want again in life.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch12'>XII</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>A</span>fter</span> some hours, by crouching knee to chin,
covered by his saddle, a kind of warmth crept
over Hi, so that he slept an uneasy sleep, full of
cramps and nightmares.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Uneasy as it was, it was deep. Eternity seemed to go
over him like a sea. Down at the bottom of its pit, he
became conscious that the universe was vast, and that in
the depth of it, one little ache, which went from his back
into his stomach, from the cold, was himself. All kinds of
vast things watched this ache with indifference; but the
ache was all-important to himself. It kept urging him to
rise. “That is the point,” he muttered, “I’ve got to rise.
I’ve got to rise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something from the heart of things was calling him to
rise. With an effort he shook himself out of the cramps
and nightmares into the coolness and stillness of reality.
He thrust aside the saddle and sat up, aching. There were
the stars overhead, in all those odds and ends of constellations
of the southern heaven which have no easy guides
for the wanderer like King Charles’s Wain. The grass was
all pale about him, the trees were all black, tree-tops and
grass-tops seemed to waver a little: something near the
water pan made a ticking noise, as though some mouse
were snouting there under fallen twigs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From all these things, he came suddenly to focus on the
thing which mattered. His horse was staring intently,
rigidly and silently at something which Hi could not see.
This was why he had been called upon to rise. The sleeping
partner in his horse had called him up to face the enemy.
A wave of fear passed from the horse into the master; Hi
sat up to stare as the horse stared; he rose to his knees and
stared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could see nothing but the film of the grass against the
black of the forest, yet somewhere in that space was something
at which the horse was staring with all his nature.
In that dimness and indistinctness before the darkness
something was abroad, not stirring, but staring at them.
What was it? Was it a snake waiting to strike, or a puma,
or a ghost out of the grave? There was nothing to show,
nothing to see; but both knew that there was something,
deadly unspeakable. Hi felt the hair rise on his brow: he
heard the sweat drip from himself and his horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How long this lasted he never knew, but at last, from
that indistinctness in front, there came the faintest of
sounds, that marked the ending of the tension. Something
dark seemed on the instant to merge back into the darkness
behind it. There was no noise of step or tread, no motion
in the grass, nothing that one could swear to seeing, only
the suggestion of a scent, like the ghost of the flavour of
musk, and then the knowledge that the thing was no longer
there. He believed that his horse sighed with relief, as
he himself did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could see nothing, but the horse saw. Hi saw the
horse’s eyes follow the thing slowly round. What thing
was it that could move so slowly? What thing of precaution
was moving, pausing and deliberating? When it
deliberated, its will hardened against them, the horse knew
it, and Hi knew it from the horse. The fear came again,
that the thing might strike, had almost made up its mind to
strike: it had some kind of a mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet again the tension snapped suddenly, with a sigh of
relief from horse and man: the evil seemed to withdraw, so
that the horse felt free to change his position. Then the
night, which for some minutes had seemed to hold her
breath, began again to speak with her myriad voices out of
the darkness of her cruelty. The whisper and the droning
of the forest sharpened into the rustlings of snakes, the
wails of victims, the cry of the bats after the moths, and
the moan of the million insects seeking blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some two hours Hi stayed by his horse, waiting and
watching, till at last he felt free to lie down to rest. The
insects took toll of him, but he contrived some shelter,
and being young, as well as weary, he slept again. He may
perhaps have slept for as much as an hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was wakened suddenly by that inner messenger who
told him that the danger, whatever it was, had returned.
He heard the horse wheel round with a little cry to face
in a new direction. Hi faced it, but again could see nothing
but a blackness of trees, now like steel at the tops from the
false dawn. Hi stood beside the horse, with an arm on his
neck, staring. There was tenseness and silence, with fear
passing from beast to man and back again. What was
there, Hi could not see, but the horse saw. All that Hi
thought that he could distinguish was a blotch of blackness
which wavered against the blackness that was steadfast.
It seemed to him to be some snake swollen to the size of
an upright at Stonehenge. When the waiting became
unbearable he challenged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see you,” he said. “What do you want?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There came no answer, nor any sound from the thing; the
only result of the challenge seemed to be that the tenseness
became more tense and the silence more still. Staring
forward more intently, Hi felt that the blotch of blackness
was not there, but that something was there, but what
thing? Ah, what thing could it be that was slow, silent
as the coming of a fever, and deadlier than pestilence?
It was there making up its mind for half an hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, as before, in one instant it was not: it was gone.
Hi looked up at the heaven suddenly, to find that the steel
of the tree-tops was now burnished with colour. Some birds
in those tree-tops right over where the danger had been now
woke all together with ejaculations and the clapping of
wings, which spread from tree to tree, till all the forest
was awake. High, shrill cacklings and screamings, full of
good spirits and energy rang aloud all over the wood. With
a clattering of the quills of wing-feathers, some big birds
shook themselves loose from sleep. After a time, flocks
of little birds passed overhead with thin, sweet cries. The
false dawn, which had made the sky warm with colour,
died away into dimness; then, almost at once, the darkness
thinned and dispersed: colour surged into mid-heaven in
flames of scarlet, which made the tree-tops glow. Within a
few minutes it was dawn. Hi was cold, miserable, swollen
and itching from bites, but safe from the powers of darkness;
the night was gone; he had never understood what
night was, now he knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the glow of the warmth with all things so full of colour
he looked at the place where the danger had threatened.
The danger had now gone, the horse was eating at peace.
There was no trace nor track that Hi could read, nor any
mark that he could find, that might not have been made
by himself or the horse. Yet about the places where the
danger had been a flavour or sickliness of musk still lingered,
so faintly that it could hardly be noted. “It is not musk,
either,” Hi said to himself. “It has a sort of edge to it.
It is the smell of some stuff that kills, it has to do with
death. This is a deadly place; we’ll be gone from it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having groomed and fed his horse and himself, he set out
from that clearing. “I have got my bearings now,” he
said. “I am facing north, probably straight towards
Anselmo. Any going to the right will bring me out towards
La Boca; any going to the left will put me too far to the
west. As I am headed now, I ought to be clear of the
forest by noon. I don’t know what Rosa will think of me,
losing all this time, but I’ll get there somehow, so that she
shan’t be too much ashamed of me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had not ridden for two minutes before he felt a change
in his horse; all the gallantry was gone from his going,
there was no spark nor stir passing from horse to rider.
“Poor old boy,” he thought, “he has been awake all night,
from that thing in the clearing, he is feeling a bit tucked
up.” He went gently through the forest for rather more
than an hour. It was good going, more open than it had
been the day before, with patches of savannah where the
trend of the shadows gave him his directions. He was
thankful for these savannahs, because of their warmth and
colour, which restored him like draughts of wine. But his
horse went on like a log beneath him, with no life nor spirit,
and his own heart was troubled enough at all the delays.
“At least, I am started now,” he thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came to a green expanse, broken up with pools of
water, where reeds of delicate stems, topped by pale blue
tufts of flowers, attracted multitudes of golden-throats,
which poised at each tuft and glittered as they fluttered.
The patch was perhaps three hundred yards across and of
an intense glittering greenness. “Soft going,” Hi muttered;
“this is bog.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The horse knew something about earth of that greenness.
He would have none of it. Hi dismounted to look at it;
it looked like bottomless bog leading to deep water, with
bog on the further side. In the midst of the green expanse
there was a sort of bubbling wriggle of small snakes.
Sometimes a red turtle crawled out of a pool, wallowed along
the mud and sank into another. “Here’s a lively place,”
Hi thought. “I’ll have to get round it. I’ll work round
here to the right and go round the end of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He set off in good spirits, but after two miles or more of
exploration he found no end of it. Instead of an end, the
bog seemed to have a growth in that direction into a lake
or pool edged with bottomless mud. Something in the
water, whether tincture or germ, had killed the trees which
it had touched. Three or four hundred dead trees stood in
a pool the colour of stagnant blood, each tree was leafless
and barkless: they stood as bones, silent save for the beetles
clicking on them. “Here’s a nice place,” Hi thought.
“It would be first rate as a shrubbery to a morgue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no sign of any way across or round that bog.
The blood-pool stretched on to what looked like an oil-pool,
black and rancid, with prismatic gleams oozing outwards
from it. Beyond this, there was swamp, with enormous
plants with branches like water-lily roots, or like knots of
snakes intertwisted, rising from the pools. The bark of
these twigless branches had been gashed, perhaps in some
act of growth, so that it hung in weepers, showing the red
or yellow flesh beneath; “beggars with sores,” Hi called
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since I can’t get round here,” he said, “I must go back
and try the other end.” The mosquitoes were eating him
alive here, so that when he clapped his neck suddenly his
hand was covered with blood. As he had heard that oil
will drive away mosquitoes, he smeared his hands, face and
neck with the skimmings of one of the pools; this relieved
him for a time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the other end, he found a tongue of dry land which
seemed to thrust right across the bog. “Here is a way,”
he thought, “this will take me over.” He set out upon it
with good hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a mile of open going, the reeds closed in on both
sides of him, so that he rode in a narrow space between
ranks of stems, grey-green and golden, topped by plumes of
blue. The horse needed continual urging forward, until
he came to a patch of a plant like rest-harrow, which
attracted him; he seemed eager to crop it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if it’s going to do you good, old boy,” Hi said,
“you’d better eat some.” He slipped the bit from his
mouth to let him eat, but it proved to be a sick beast’s
fancy; he would not eat. He plucked two or three
croppings, but dropped them from his mouth. Hi didn’t
like the look of his eyes nor the feel of his skin. “What is
it, old son?” he asked. “What is turning you up? Was
it the rain yesterday, or what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The horse drooped his head and trembled a little. “This
is bad,” Hi thought, “but I must get on, cruelty or no. He
may be better presently.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He led the horse forward till he reached a place where
the reeds grew across the causeway. He thrust into the
reeds for a minute, when he found that he was treading in
water over his shoes. Four or five inches down, the roots
of the reeds, the surface of the earth, or both things together,
made a hard bed on which he could walk. “I think it will
be all right,” he said; “it seems fairly safe: anyway, this
is my direction; this bog can’t last much longer: I must
be almost across, and I simply won’t waste time by trying
for another way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He slopped on slowly for another hundred yards, leading
the horse. The reeds grew thicker as he proceeded. They
were hard in the leaf like cactus and tough in the stem like
bamboo. He had to back into them, dragging the horse,
who came unwillingly; sometimes he could not break
through, but had to edge round a clump. It was hot work
paddling backward thus. After the first hundred yards
the water began to deepen. Birds which had never before
seen a man moved away at his coming; a deep, intense
droning of insects sounded about him: insects got into his
eyes and seemed to like being there. Many midges, with
tiny black spots upon their wings, thrust under the wrist-bands
of his shirt and below his collar, where they bit like
sparks of fire. Suddenly the reeds let in a great deal more
light: he had backed through into the open. He found
himself standing almost knee deep in a lake of water two or
three miles long by a mile broad. There was no way across
from there: he had come the wrong way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps, in his disappointment, had his horse been fit,
he might have tried to swim across, holding to his horse’s
tail. The temptation to try was strong in him; the water,
though deep, looked so beautiful, and the distance, in that
light, so small. What made him hesitate was a patch of
weed near the further shore. “I might get snarled up in
that,” he thought, “or come to a mud patch and not be
able to land.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the instant, something gave a sharp and savage pluck
at his leg; he kicked the thing from him and at once
splashed back among the reeds. “One of those snappers
that father was always gassing about,” he thought, as he
recovered from his start; “he always said that the fresh-water
fish would eat a man. I must give up swimming
it, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned back in depression through the reeds. “Just
as I thought I’d crossed it,” he muttered. His horse
seemed to share his depression. He came back through
the reeds in a way which seemed to say, “I could have told
you that you couldn’t cross here. Now you’ll have to fag
all the way back again, and you know that I have not any
strength to waste.” Going back made him realise how
much further he had come than he had supposed. It
seemed to be miles to the starting place, but he reached it
at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dash it all,” he said, while he halted to consider, “I
believe that this is the place which Anton mentioned: the
place he meant when he said I couldn’t go so, because
there was no ground. Well, if I’d only thought of that
sooner, I might have spared myself some pain. Now he
said that there was some sort of a track hereabouts, which
would take me clean out of the forest. Puzzle, find the
track. I see no trace of any track. I’ll take a cast, to see
if I can hit it off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took two casts, one in each direction, but could see
nothing like a track. “If there was one,” he thought, “it
was very likely washed out by the rain yesterday. Anyhow,
I have tried the east and the middle: they are both
wrong. If there’s any way at all to the north from here, it
must be to the west. Here it is mid-day pretty nearly,
and I have not started yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He set out to the west, through a forest of vast trees,
which stood over him like gods watching a beetle. When he
had ridden for an hour, he turned into a valley, down
which suddenly a mist of rain came sweeping. It came less
violently than the rain of the day before, but settled in as
though it would last for ever. In a few minutes the forest
had changed to a dimness full of footsteps and sighings,
across which shapes of cloud faded and formed and faded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must keep on, and then bear to the right,” Hi said.
“This won’t last as long as it did yesterday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He kept on for some hours at a walk, till he was stopped
by a bog. A river or large stream which perhaps ran into
the lake at its western end here had silted up its mouth over
some acres of forest. A rotting mush barred the way;
there was no passing. As moving to the right brought
him to reeds growing in water, he moved to the left, uphill,
until his horse stopped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had saved a feed of corn against an emergency: the
horse nosed at it, but would not eat. “Poor beast,” Hi
thought, “he’s in a pretty bad way. I’ll rub him down
and give him a rest. If we both rest for a little it will do
no harm.” After grooming the horse, he contrived what
shelter he could, and fell asleep. He woke once, to find
the rain streaming on his face, woke a second time, to find
that the rain had stopped; then sleep took hold of him
body and soul and held him as one dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He slept all through the afternoon and would have slept
longer far into the night, but that he was suddenly startled
by the shattering of a volley of shots from some place far
away. “There it is,” he cried, starting up, “that is Don
Manuel coming to the rescue.” Other shots followed, some,
at first, close together in volleys, the later ones singly.
After the shots, listening intently as he was, he thought
that he heard the sound of many horses going together at
a fast trot. Some such noise there was, it rang out, died
down, clopped and clinked and then clattered. “Of
course, it can’t be Don Manuel,” he said, coming to himself.
“But it may be the Whites driving away the Reds. Anyhow,
people are there: the forest ends. It may even be
Anselmo. Come on, horse, here’s the world again. ‘They
must be men, because they’re fighting, and they must be
civilised because they’re doing it with guns.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The horse seemed the better either for the rest or the
sound of his fellows; when Hi mounted, he set off with
some kind of spirit. In a quarter of an hour he came to
something which made the horse whinny; it was a trail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here it is,” Hi cried, “the very little trail which Anton
spoke of. Now I shall be out of it in no time. Just as
well, too, because I’ve slept a lot longer than I thought:
it is almost night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun was indeed behind Melchior; the birds had
homed and were now screaming before falling silent. The
patches of sky over the forest turned slowly scarlet, paled
yellow, then changed to a green in which stars were bright.
The sparks of the fireflies began to pass upon the air: cold
silence and darkness came with them into the forest, so
that Hi shivered. His heart, none the less, was beating
with hope, because the horse was going with confidence.
Then from somewhere ahead came the distant lowing of
cattle, which brought tears to Hi’s eyes. It was the noise
made by the cows of home coming into the barton at
Tencombe: now here, in this strange place, it told of the
homes of men, where life was lived wisely, away from towns,
and far from the madness of rulers like Don Lopez.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly, from somewhere ahead, a single shot rang out:
it may have been far away, but in that still air it sounded
near by. It was followed almost at once by the sound of
the gallop of a horse, which was either running away or
being ridden by a man in fear for his life. It stretched at
a full gallop across his front and so away into the west:
one horse only, mad with fear, or with his rider’s fear, going
at his utmost: from what?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I knew from what,” Hi thought. “Listen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He listened: many men were talking and shouting.
Then there came the noise of many horses together:
seventy or a hundred; “as many as in a hunt at home,”
moving along a paven place at a walk, then rising to a
fast trot together. “And they are within two miles of
me,” Hi thought, “going from me.” He shouted, but
had no answer save the sound of the horses dying away
into the west. The cattle lowed again. “There must be
a ranch there,” Hi said. “I’ll go to where those cows are.”
He hailed again and was answered by little white owls
which followed him on both sides, perhaps for grubs or
beetles kicked up by the horse in his going.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently he came out of the forest into a little plantation
of trees made as a wind-screen, possibly for cocoa. Beyond
this, he saw a cleared space in which, less than half a mile
away, were the long, low white buildings of a ranch lit
up as for a festival. To his right, there seemed to be
ordered plantations of fruit trees in blossom: he saw long
streaks of paleness which he judged to be peach trees. To
the left, rather further from him, were high corrales, where
pale cattle moved and lowed; he heard them stamp and
push: often they rattled their horns upon the bars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rode nearer to the buildings, then paused to hail,
crying out that he was English, and that they were not to
shoot. He had no answer to any of his hails. The place
was still, save for the cattle: there was not even a dog.
“The men must be all at supper,” he thought, “or milking,
if they milk in these parts. But it is odd that they have
no dog.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moon, now some three or four nights old, was low
down over the house, near the tops of Sierras, which
glittered. “I don’t know what sort of a course I’ve been
riding,” he thought, “I seem to have been going due west:
or is the moon different down here? It seems to slop about
all over the place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leaving the moon for the moment, he rode on towards
the house, calling out that he was a friend. Some shrubs,
newly planted, on both sides of his track, gave out a strong
sweet scent: beetles and fireflies were swarming over them
with a droning of wings which made the silence the more
apparent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is anybody there?” he cried. “Hullo there. Don’t
shoot: I am a friend. House ahoy, I’m a friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time he was at a long white gate which had been
thrust and propped open far back to its supporting posts
and rails. He entered the gate, riding cautiously, still
calling that he was a friend, but having no answer, and
hearing no sound, save the moving of the cattle in the
corrales and the buzz of insects in the shrubs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not even a dog,” he repeated, “and there must be
fifty men in a ranch like this. What if they are all in
ambush, waiting for me to come on?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not likely,” he thought, after a moment, “but it
is possible. They may be waiting at those windows to
plug me like a nutmeg grater. But if they are, they’ll
wait to see who is coming with me. It feels to me as if
the house were deserted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond the gate, the way had been paven, the horse’s
hoofs struck on a road; the house cast back the echoes,
clink, clink, at each step. As he advanced, the young
moon bobbed lower down towards the house-roof: no
sound came from the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey,” Hi called, “I am a friend, an amigo; un ami.
Je suis Anglais. Ingles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something in the ominousness of the silence brought his
calling to an end. There was something dreadful at work
here. Something had stricken the heart of that house so
that its life had ceased. Yet not quite ceased, for as Hi
dismounted he saw a breath of smoke blow from one of the
chimneys across the curve of the moon. “What in the
wide earth is happening here?” he asked himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At a little distance from the house, to the left of the
entrance, were tethering posts from which iron rings hung.
He had thought at first that they were the posts at which
the slaves were flogged; but he now knew better. He
hitched his horse to one of the rings, and then went slowly
towards the door. The house seemed to grow bigger as
he approached it: he felt himself shrink. He wished that
his footsteps did not make such a noise upon the road.
“It is deserted,” he told himself, “it is all deserted. But
it is all lit up, so that it can only have been deserted within
the hour, after that shot was fired here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Six steps from the door a thought came to him which
made his heart leap for joy. “Of course, this is Anselmo,”
he said. “I’ve come to Anselmo. This is the Elena’s
ranch, and the Elenas and all their men have either gone
to Don Manuel or joined the other Whites. That is it of
course. Well, here I am. And they’ve moved all their
horses with them; those were the horses which I heard.
I’m late enough, but word has reached them. ’Zeke must
have got through.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thinking thus he crossed the two broad stone steps of
the perron to the estancia door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An electric light burned over the door: some moths were
butting at it. The door itself was of black maruca, bound
with steel. A big bronze pipkin, such as the country people
all over Meruel use for milking, hung beside the door.
“I suppose this is the bell,” he thought. “It’s just like a
castle in the Morte d’Arthur. Here goes for a bang.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He struck the bronze, which clanged aloud, spinning
round upon its cord and thrilling: then he struck again
more loudly, twice. The clang died down into a trembling
of the air, but all within the house was silent, there was
neither voice nor footstep. There came a rustling of wind
from the madre de cacao trees; nobody came, nobody
spoke. “Is anyone inside there?” Hi cried. There was
no answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe that there is anybody here,” he said.
Then the thought came: “Suppose the people have all
been rounded up or killed by the Reds?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, no,” he thought, “the Reds would have sacked
and burned the place. It is not that. I don’t know what
it is: it must be something queer.” He struck the bronze
for a last time.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch13'>XIII</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>“W</span>ell,</span> if they won’t answer, I’ll see if I can
go in,” he said. He lifted the latch by plucking
the plaited leather bobbin: the door was not
locked, it opened before him into a long lit corridor or hall
where an English clock was ticking. As he opened the door,
the wind blowing in shook the pictures on the wall: they
swayed and clacked for an instant, then steadied. There
were lighted rooms opening from each side of the corridor,
but no sound of any living being.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo, you inside here,” Hi called. “I am a friend.
Is anyone there? Señor Elena. Señor George, Señor
William. Hey, hey, heya. Is anyone here at all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice rang along the corridor and died away: no
one was there. “Very well, I’ll go in,” Hi said. He stepped
in, and closed the door against the wind. As he did so a
letter and envelope, which had been lying on the edge
of a table near him, fell to the stone flags with a clatter. He
replaced them on the table; then paused to look about him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had heard that men of the great ranches lived like
princes. The hall in which he stood was bare, big and
white, lit by electric lights. There were two stiff black
chairs, two black pictures of yellow nymphs, a table heaped
with silver horse-trappings, and the English grandfather’s
clock, gravely telling the time. He walked up to the
clock and read the words on the dial:</p>

<div class='lgc' style='margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>Edward Hendred.</p>
<p class='line'>1807</p>
<p class='line'>Abingdon.</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>These two little things of old Berkshire met thus in
this strange house so many miles from Thames and Down.
“Hendred of Abingdon,” he repeated. “There may be
a Berkshire man here who may know father.” He glanced
at the pictures of the yellow nymphs in their clothes blown
out in the grand manner. “Religious pictures,” he thought
and glanced away. The house was so still that he hardly
dared to go further.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What can have happened?” he asked. “Some fight
or some show or what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He walked to the nearest door, on his left. The door
was ajar, shewing a lit room: he knocked at the door, had
no answer, and therefore looked in. It was a big, long
room, in use as the messroom of the household, for whom
thirty places had been laid on the table. Food in abundance
had been set there for a meal, which had been begun.
Baskets of small Meruel loaves were on a sideboard near
the door: he felt these by accident as he put out his hand:
the under loaves were still warm from the oven. There was
warmth in the vast silver cazuela tureen, which stood, more
than half empty at the head of the table. The table was
littered with the mess of the meal: broken loaves, bowls
which had been used for cazuela, halves of oranges, skins
of bananas, and the bones of big birds like turkeys. Yet
from the look of the plates Hi felt that the meal had never
been finished: something had interrupted it before they
had reached the coffee and cigarettes. Somebody with some
news had come there soon after they were half way through,
then chairs had been thrust back and food left, half eaten
and the eaters and talkers had gone. Why had they gone,
and where? Hi did not like the feeling of this house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went again to the hall and cried: “Is there anybody
here?” But there was no answer. “There must be someone
somewhere in all this barrack,” he said. “Surely in
the kitchen or outhouses there will be a woman or a negro
or a peon. There must be at least a caretaker or night-watchman.
The kitchens will be along the corridor somewhere
at the back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went down the corridor, where he found the kitchen.
It was a vast room, bare, clean, and empty of people. The
fire, which had done the work of cooking, had been allowed
to die down; but the castle-kettle, once full of water for
coffee and the washing-up of the dishes, was still boiling
and half full. A black cat with its paw round its face was
curled up asleep on a mat on a chair. “I’m glad that
there is something alive here,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Doors opened from the kitchen into outhouses, sculleries
and larders: Hi felt a dread of looking into these rooms,
but he overcame it: no one was there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” he said, “if there’s no one to ask, I will make
a mash for my poor horse. No one could object to that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took one of the big round-up stew cauldrons which lay
against a wall. In this he made a hot mash of bread for
his horse, adding some salt. He carried it out to the horse,
who seemed glad of the warm food for a few instants;
but it was not all that he had hoped; in a few instants
his muzzle dropped from it. “Poor old boy,” Hi said,
“I wish I knew what I could give you, that you would
like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lingered by the horse for a few minutes, to pull his
ears, and rub him down. The breeze which had set in
struck cold, so Hi moved the horse to a more sheltered
place behind the immense rain vats a few yards from the
tethering posts. He had hoped that somebody would
come there while he was outside with the horse, but there
came neither sight nor sound of anybody.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go in to explore,” Hi said. “There must be
someone, and if there’s someone there may be something
I can do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was harder to enter the house for this second time
than it had been before. The uncanniness was greater
now. The clock still ticked, the light still burned, the table
still stood uncleared. “I don’t want to be caught bagging
things in a strange house,” Hi thought, “but I’m jolly
well going to bag some food and leave some money for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He ate and drank of what was on the table, to the
amount (as he judged) of a peseta, reckoning in the bread
for the horse. He left one of his five pesetas on the table
for this. “What am I to do, and where am I to go?”
he wondered. “If I leave this? This may be Anselmo;
almost must be: yet where are all the Elenas gone?
Perhaps I’ll find something in the other rooms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were three more rooms in the corridor of the hall:
two on the opposite side, one on his side, nearer the kitchens.
The rooms further down the corridor had the look of being
offices or studies. “I’ll go into those, first,” he said.
“Very likely I’ll come upon somebody dead in one, or on
the old mad doctor who runs this private madhouse.”
He knocked at the door beside him, which was shut: for
one instant he was shocked by thinking that at the sound of
his knocking someone within the room had turned the
pages of a book. He opened the door upon a dark room,
into which the breeze blew from an open ventilator high
up in the wall. He saw the light switches and switched
the lights fully on. The room was the estancia office, as
he had supposed. There was a safe, built into the wall.
There were two long tables heaped with papers; but
another thing impressed Hi: chairs had been lifted from
the floor on to these tables, so that the floor might be
swept. Two brooms had begun to sweep the floor: there
was the tide mark of dust, earth, torn paper, cigarette ends
and cigar butts half way across the room. There were the
two brooms resting against the table, just as the unknown
sweepers had left them when their task had been interrupted
by what? On a third table was a row of flat, square,
white china dishes, each containing about a pint of brown
or reddish liquid. Hi judged that the liquid was a chemical
of some sort, perhaps a parasite mixture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He crossed the corridor to the room opposite. This was
plainly a room for the women. It contained a long settle
which faced a row of spinning wheels. On a table there
were heaps of palm-blades partly unravelled into the white
bast from which the Meruel women plaited their hats. At
the further end of the room were two hand-looms on which
some weavers had already woven parts of saints for the back
cloth of an altar. Someone had spilled a little bottle of scent
upon the palm-blades. It was oozing from its cork into
a rivulet which had dripped into a pool upon the floor.
“There has been a hurry, even here,” Hi said. “Oh, I
wish to goodness I had come here an hour ago. If only
I had not taken that wrong turn, or slept quite so long,
I might have found the people here: and they are good
people, doing good things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went again into the corridor to listen: no one had
entered the house. “There are all the outhouses to search
through presently,” he said. “I must find someone before
I can leave here. I’ll try this other room, opposite the
dining-room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This proved to be the main living-room of a company of
men. One side of it was slung with Indian hammocks,
loosely woven of dyed fibres: the rest was in the confusion
in which undisciplined men will live. It was littered with
clothes, shot-guns, cartridges, belts, knives, books, papers,
watches, money, cigars, broken cigarettes, pipes, spurs,
quirts, matches, plugs of tobacco, photographs of girls,
prints of horses, shoes, laces, straps and twitches. Tobacco
had been smoked there not more than an hour before, but
another smell also struck Hi’s nostrils. It was a familiar
smell, yet for an instant in that smell of tobacco he could
not say what it was. Then the sight of an empty brass
revolver shell upon the floor reminded him that what he
smelt was the smell of gunpowder. Somebody had burned
a cartridge in that room not more than an hour before:
there was the shell of the cartridge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He picked it up, with the thought that it was the heaviest
revolver cartridge he had ever seen. “Why,” he thought,
“a thing like this would stop a bison. This is a Jack the
Giant Killer. Whoever has fired a thing like this in here?”
He put the brass shell to his nose and instantly the pungent
smell brought scenes into his mind of two months before.
The first scene was of the wood on the down above Tencombe,
on a sunny January afternoon, when he had shot a pheasant,
and had stood to jerk out the shell. A red squirrel had
appeared on one of the leafless oaks there: it had run
along the branch to jabber at him, to within six feet of
him. This scene floated by into another of the Blowbury
Woods at sunset, when he had waited in the cold for wood-pigeons.
The orange sky to the west had been netted
black by the elm twigs, and the woods had stood still in the
cold. He had had a shot at last, but had missed with both
barrels, had jerked out the cartridges, and had smelt just
this smell, from fumes curling up at him out of the breech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He dropped the shell: it fell with a tinkle and rolled
from him. He was standing, at that moment, some four
feet from the door, within the room; he had not much
more than entered to take his survey. Fear, anxiety,
homesickness, and the torment of failing his friends were
all preying upon him. Then he looked up, suddenly,
towards one of the windows, where something made his
heart stand still. A man with a white face and blazing
eyes was watching him through the window with a look
of rage which made his blood run cold. The man’s brow
was pressed on the pane, while his right hand reached back
for a gun. That man was no dweller in the house, but
a spy and an enemy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not stay for the hand to come round with the gun,
but slipped sideways into the hall, closed the door behind
him and drew the bolt with which each of those doors was
fitted. He slipped sideways along the hall to the front
door, which he bolted likewise. Then he stood for a
minute with his heart thumping, listening to hear whether
the man were breaking through the window or coming to
the door for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a minute, during which nothing happened, his eye
caught the letter that had been blown to the floor when he
entered the house. The letter was on the table within a
few feet of him. “It must have been the last thing read
in this house,” he thought. “What if it were the cause of
all the people leaving here? It may have brought the
deciding news, probably did. At least, it may be addressed
to one of the Elenas, or will tell me if this be Anselmo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at the envelope, which was addressed in a
bold hand</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>—— J. G.</p>

<p class='noindent'>He had a horror of looking at a private letter, even when
made public in a book or newspaper. “It’s a skunk’s
trick,” he said, “but I do want to know where I am. I’ll
apologise if I ever have the chance.” He pulled the
enclosure from the envelope to read it. It proved not to
be the letter (that had gone), but a piece of paper which
had been sent with the letter. The paper was a half-sheet
of coarse bluish notepaper on which the same hand had
pencilled the words, “Si, Anselmo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now what on earth does that mean?” Hi asked himself.
“Yes, Anselmo? I would give something to know
what is happening in this place.” All was silent about him,
save for that ticking of the clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a little chirrupping cry, the black cat, which had
been sleeping in the chair in the kitchen, came running
along the passage. It was a slim, small-headed, short-coated
cat, not yet of full growth; it rubbed against Hi’s
legs and purred; Hi leaned down to stroke it, but watched
the passage to the kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That man has come in by way of the kitchen,” Hi
thought. “He has scared the cat, or let in a draught upon
him. I’ll be out of this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The office window seemed to be the exit most likely to
bring him out beside his horse: he slipped into the office
and closed the door behind him. Then he listened, with a
beating heart, for some swift, stealthy footstep in the
corridor or outside the window. “Perhaps,” he thought,
“I shan’t hear any footsteps, only the brute’s hand on the
latch. He’s a spy and a Red, that devil. Listen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In that silence, the beating of the clock clanged like the
tolling of a bell. The cat, left to preen his fur in the hall,
padded back towards the kitchen. Hi was on the point
of turning to open the inner shutter of the window, when a
little shrill whirring bell began to scream like an alarm-clock
upon some metal hooks on a stand at the table end.
The shock of the sound made his hair stand stiff upon his
head. He saw the instrument shaking on its hooks with
the vehemence of the bell. He had read and heard of these
things, but had never before seen one. It rang for ten
seconds, then paused, then rang for five seconds and
paused again. Then it rang again with determination
for half a minute on end, as though bent on having an
answer. Someone was telephoning to that house of the
dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His courage came back in a few seconds. Someone was
telephoning: why should he not answer? Possibly an
English voice would speak to him or someone who knew
English. Even if there were a Red outside the door, he
owed it to Carlotta to run the risk, if by running it he could
learn where he was and where he should go next. He did
not know how to take the call. He lifted the instrument
from its hooks and listened, now at one end, now at the
other, to silence. “The thing is stopped,” he said. “I
don’t know how to work the beastly thing. Yes?” he
called. “Yes? Who is there? What is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No answer come to him, not even the murmur of other
voices which sometimes comes over the telephone. Then
suddenly the thought came to him that perhaps the wire
had been cut, or the unseen speaker shot down somewhere
far away. He put down the instrument, moved to the
window and opened the shutter. As he pulled it aside, the
bell tinkled a little, whimpered again, as though about to
ring again, and then stopped. “The wires are cut,” he
muttered, “that devil the spy has done it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peering out of the window, he could see nothing but a
darkness which gradually took shapes to itself of trees
swaying in the wind, palms clicking and clacking, and
stars which became brighter as he gazed. “Here goes,”
Hi thought, “I cannot see that devil; I’ll risk it.” So he
scrambled out, landed on his feet, and then stood for an
instant lest someone should spring upon him. No one
sprang; there was neither sight nor sound of anyone, only
his horse nosing at the earth, and the wind shuffling and
clicking. He unhitched his rein, mounted and cautiously
rode forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the space near the door he halted to listen and to try
to see. No one was there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ll be where the spy was,” he thought, “crouched
out of this cold wind. I’ll see and make sure.” He edged
his horse a little and a little to the corner of the house,
where he held him ready for a dash. Very cautiously he
craned forward along his horse’s neck, till he could see
round the corner. Then he stared with all his might at the
space lit by the windows of the living-room. No horsemen
were gathered there out of the wind, but at the lit window
the figure of the spy still stood with his hand reached back
for his gun and his brow pressed upon the pane. He was
staring into the window: Hi could not see his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Golly,” Hi thought, “he’s still there. He’s come here
again.” He did not move a muscle for fully fifteen
seconds; the spy did not move. Hi waited for that right
hand to flash up suddenly with the gun, but it did not
come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Hi thought, “But what’s he up to? He saw me in
the room five minutes ago; then probably he went after
me in the kitchen. What brings him here again? What is
he staring at there? Can there be another man in the
room? He must know that I cleared out: he saw me do
it. Is he waiting to plug me when I come back, or
what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He waited for another fifteen seconds, but the man never
stirred a muscle. He stood at the window, pressed to it,
intently staring. Hi had seen cats and foxes waiting
intently thus before springing; but the cats and foxes had
at least trembled with the intensity of their control, this
man was motionless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But who in the wide earth is he staring at?” Hi asked
himself. “There must be someone in that room whom I
never saw, but who was there when I was there.” Then
he thought, “Whatever is in the room, there is something
wrong with that man. He is not quite of this world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was an opinion which the horse seemed to share,
and the presence of it in the horse made Hi’s terror stronger.
Yet the intentness of that watching figure “not quite of
this world,” was fascinating. All purpose will arrest the
purposeless, but this deadly purpose was absorbing. It
made Hi forget that looking at a person will draw that
person’s eyes towards the looker. For the moment, he
did not care; he longed to see what the man saw. He
stared: his horse also stared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly a gust of the wind, now blowing at its height,
caught the window by which Hi had escaped. Hi heard
it crash to, with a tinkle of glass. The draught inside the
house flung some door open, and blew ajar the unhasped
casement by which the watcher stood. The result was
something which Hi had not expected. The man slithered
sideways, scraping along the wall, and collapsed, with his
head towards Hi, and his gun arm twisted askew as no living
arm could ever twist. The light, shining now from the
unobstructed window pane, showed Hi the bullet-hole
through which the body’s death had come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The horse had swerved aside when the body fell. The
knowledge that the man was dead, and had been dead from
the first, came to Hi in a flash, at his first movement. The
smell of powder in the room suddenly became significant.
“That explains the big revolver shell,” he thought. “Oh,
golly, let’s get out of this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The horse was out of sorts, but the cold had touched him
up, and something of his rider’s terror was afflicting him.
He swerved away from the house and galloped ahead across
a peach plantation. Hi heard horses whinny and a man’s
voice hailing him from behind him as he entered the
plantation. The dreadful fear that it was the dead man
mounted on the nightmare made him crouch on his horse’s
neck and urge him forward. He heard shouts, calling to
him to stop, or so it seemed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At any other time, he might have stopped; but he could
not now, after the corpse flopping down towards him. In
a few moments, he was certain that men were shouting at
him, several men, in earnest, shouting no Christian tongue.
By this time he had crossed the plantation fence at a place
where the bars were down, he was heading across a patch
of savannah towards the forest. He heard horses coming
after him. He called out that he was English and a friend.
The man who was nearest to him, perhaps mistaking this
for an insult, fired a shot in the direction of the voice, but
missed. Hi crackled through some hard-leaved scrub
into the darkness of the covert, leaving the direction to
the horse. Many horses crackled into the scrub behind
him. He called out again that he was English and a
friend, but his bailers cursed him, called to him to stop and
opened fire at him. As he rode, he heard the piping drone
of birds; then, suddenly, some of the birds spat and hissed
close to his ears, twigs fell from the trees about him; he
knew suddenly that the birds were bullets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pursuers, with one exception, soon pulled up, the
firing ceased, only one man still followed, calling to him to
stop. Suddenly this one pursuer pulled up, and Hi at the
same instant felt a coldness of fear all over him. There
came a shot and shock, his horse swerved violently,
staggered, recovered, and bolted into the forest. “He hit
the horse,” Hi said, “but not badly, or he wouldn’t go like
this.” For the rest of the ride his task was to keep on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How long he rode the forest he never knew: the horse
went on in his terror till he could go no more, then he
halted, full of the ends of terror, nervy, starting at a shadow
and trembling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moon was long since down. Hi could make out that
he was in a kind of pan or crater in the forest, with wavy
indistinctness everywhere, smelling of balm. He dismounted,
tried to examine his horse, who would not let
himself be examined, but had certainly been cut on the
crupper. He tried to comfort the poor beast. Coming to
a patch of grass near a brook, he offered him grazing and a
drink, both of which he refused. “Poor old Bingo,” Hi
said, “you’re dead beat, you shall rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tethered, unsaddled and spread his coat upon him.
The beast stood where he was left without attempting to
roll; he drooped his head as though he had come to the
end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now I am pretty nearly done,” Hi thought. “I don’t
know where I am. I’ve been gone four days. I’ve killed
one horse and cooked a second. Now I’m lost in the forest
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He listened for some noise of men or the creatures of
men, but heard nothing save the noises of the forest.
Terrors began to take hold of him, the dread of such a terror
as had come the night before, the terror of the man at the
window. Yet at last sleep took him from the terror of
being awake: he fell into a pit of sleep and slept for hours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During this, the fourth day of Hi’s journey, young Chacon
the notary, reached Don Manuel with all the terrible news
still to be told. By this time, men and horses had begun
to arrive at the rendezvous. Some copies of the blasphemous
proclamation, which had arrived in the west from Port
Matoche, had roused intense feeling throughout the west:
men answered Don Manuel’s call from all over San Jacinto.
While Hi was lying down to sleep, Don Manuel, with an
advanced guard of about a hundred men, pushed eastward
from the river to begin his march.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch14'>XIV</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>H</span>i</span> woke up suddenly into terror, for the forest was
filled with a crying as of creatures gone mad. A
pack of things was giving tongue with voices
madder than a fox’s bark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wild dogs gone mad,” he thought. The noise of the
yap seemed to strike between the skull and the coats of
the brain, as the idea of the weasel strikes into the brain
of the rabbit. Hi jumped to the horse, who was already
trembling. He cast loose the tethering rope and swung
himself on to the beast’s bare back, gripping the headstall,
and in an instant the horse was away with him, in a panic
which Rosas himself could not have controlled. Horse
and man fled like the bird knocked from roost in the night.
What did the bags and the saddle matter while that crying
filled the darkness?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, golly, what are those things?” he thought. “Oh,
golly, if they are after us.” All the night seemed full of
flaming eyes, but these were only fireflies, not a pack: the
crying seemed to die away. The horse floundered through
mud in a cane-brake, which crashed under his trampling.
Hi dug his head into the horse’s neck and shut his eyes: it
was like running the gauntlet for what seemed a long time.
After it, he went through tall grass, which drenched him
with dew. Hi felt him weakening beneath him as he came
out of the grass: then suddenly water appeared before him
as a lake or broad river, where the wind roused reflections
of stars. Hi saw a fish leap and splash, shaking up a
glittering; in an instant the horse was swimming, with the
gleams all round him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi knew that a very little thing would drown the horse
in his present condition; he slipped off his back, slid sideways,
caught his tail and swam with him. After about
fifty yards, the horse put his feet down, stumbled on to his
knees, but recovered and came to the bank. Hi with some
trouble scrambled up in front of him, got a purchase on
the reins, and helped him on to dry land. They stood
there gasping together for a while, being both out of breath
as well as very cold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O Lord,” Hi thought, “what on earth were those
things? I’ve never heard anything so awful. Thank
God, we got away when we did. A very little more, and
they would have been on us. I think I should go mad if
they were coming after me. Listen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no sound of any pack in cry coming after
them. They had come to a part of the wilderness which
was silent, save for the rustle of the reeds and the splash
of the leaping fish. “I suppose it’s going to rain again,”
Hi muttered with chattering teeth; “that is why the fish
are leaping. I wish I’d brought my coat and the saddle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But they were left behind with the bags in a place which
Hi was little likely to find again. “Lord, I do feel
wretched,” he said, shivering. “I’ll get away from this
water. There may be alligators in it. I never thought of
them before. Come up, old Bingo; we’ll find a place for
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They moved away through a thicket into a space which
had been burnt the year before. From the cold and from
the colour of the sky, Hi judged that it was about an hour
from the dawn. The horse stopped from exhaustion.
“You’re sicker than I am,” Hi said. “I’ll do my best to
warm you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pulled grass: the horse would not touch it, but it
served to rub him: he was trembling, his coat was staring,
and his head was down. “I’d give something for a bucket
of warm beer for him,” Hi said. “It’s hateful having
nothing: even the bread is gone. Well, I must hope for
the sun to come soon to warm him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cold was so painful that he had to move away, to
dance and flog his arms. The dawn seemed to take hours
to bring any colour to the sky, yet it came at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank God, here it comes at last,” he said. “If only
I could hear a bell with it: even a cow-bell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It came with no sound of bells, but with a clapping of
wings from all the near-by trees, as the multitudes of the
birds awoke. Their cries were not sweet like the cries of
so many English birds: only one seemed to have a sweetness
in his voice. This was a biggish bird with black wings
and orange breast. He had a sweet droning note which
said, “Woe,” then, after an interval, “Woe” again. All
the other birds seemed to be saying, “Damn it”: or so
Hi thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the light grew, the clamour of the birds rose to a
roaring, for many of them, after trying their wings, took
flight, wheeled, and sped away in their companies, to seek
for food. Some of those who cried “Woe” settled on a
tree which was covered with great white waxy flowers,
intolerably sweet. Wafts of the sweetness came to Hi on
the gusts of the wind. He saw them tear at the flowers
and eat the petals. Hi, going to the tree, tasted a petal,
thinking that what fed the birds could not harm himself.
It was like sweetened church candle or much what he had
imagined manna to have been. He ate of this manna with
the knowledge that he, too, had been fed in the wilderness.
When he returned to his horse, he found him stretched out
dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the first time that he had lost a friend by death:
he sat down beside him and wept. He was not a lad given
to weeping: he had not wept for years, but he was shaken
by the last four days, and in an extreme of loneliness,
which made him know what a friend the horse had been in
hours of danger and beastliness. Now that he was gone,
Hi was alone indeed. The horse lay dead on his off side:
his near crupper was scored with a bullet-mark. “So he
was hit after all,” Hi said, “I thought he was. And the
poor old Bingo saved me twice last night, and now he is
dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He remembered the last lines of a well-known song:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Could I think we’d meet again,</p>
<p class='line0'>It would lighten half my pain,</p>
<p class='line0'>At the place where the old horse died.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“Golly,” he thought, “I’ll never be unkind to a horse as
long as I live, after this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the stunned half hour, he picked himself up, to
look round at where he was. He stood in a space of grass,
ringed by trees, up which the creepers climbed in a fire of
flowers. To his right were the reeds and the water, with
the sun climbing above them; to his left was the dimness of
the forest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m facing north,” he said. “Almost due north.
I’m facing the plain as I stand. I’ve got about a day’s go
in me. I must get to the plain this day, or I shall never
get to it at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thought of Carlotta depending on him and Rosa
thinking that he was on his way to fetch help came back
in force. Again and again he went over in his mind the
events which had delayed him. “It is just as if I were
walking on a road which moves away from where I want
to get to,” he said. “If I were to try to avoid Anselmo,
I might get there. I’ve been four days and a bit. Or is it
five days and a bit? If I get there now, I may be too
late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he went on into the north, he began to hear voices
which spoke in his ears, bidding him to do this or that. So
many voices spoke, that he began to feel that he was
attended by a flock of things like birds, which had human
voices and flew invisibly beside him. The going lay over
miles of dead reed and broken brush which had been laid
in a tornado of the August before. The dead reed having
been laid in its prime, had not decayed, but had hardened
to something like bamboo: the young reed growing
through the old had then matted it into a cloth too high to
trample down and too tough to thrust through. Much of
this reed grew (at that season) in some inches of water. At
the end of two hours of it Hi came to a growth of trees
which had been uprooted in a line. For three hundred
yards the line stretched like a wall in a succession of the
shields of black, intertangled roots standing upright over
the hollows whence they had been plucked. It looked like
a wall of black snakes barring his way. When he had
scrambled up the wall, he saw beyond it the lake amid her
reeds, cruised over by white hawks. The beauty of the
water in that light, reflecting so much other beauty of
forest, flower and bird, each like an angel, could not be
told. To Hi, it did not come like beauty; but as a shock.
It stretched away, seemingly for miles, right across his
path, to left and to right. He could see the sun in heaven,
in this clear space; this gave him his compass points. He
had come fairly truly to the north: now the lake stretched
half a mile breadth of water in front of him. There was
neither ford nor boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must just edge along to the west,” he thought.
“This must be the water that stopped me yesterday when
I was further to the east.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After letting his clothes dry in the sun, he turned westwards
along the lake, not far from its shore, in a mood of
anxiety tempered by hunger. After a couple of hours of
going, a black bog, with seepings of oil in it which killed
plants, turned him away from the lake: he had to turn to
the south to get round it. When he had turned, he began
to think that he never would get round it. It turned him
more and more to the south, for more than an hour. When
he sat down to rest, more than half way through the morning,
he felt that he was perhaps further from Anselmo than
he had ever been.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As usually happens in the first days of starvation, with
young people, his hunger was checked by weariness and
weakness from becoming tyrannous. While he rested, he
saw a scuffling among birds in a sunlit path about a
hundred yards away. Going thither, he found some
thorny shrubs, which even at that early season were covered
with yellow plums the size of sloes. Birds, butterflies and
many other insects were gorging themselves with these
plums; he, too gorged, thinking that no better plums had
ever grown. Being schooled now to think of the next
meal whenever he had food, he contrived a sort of basket
or frail of the leaves of the spade-palm into which he packed
a couple of pounds of plums, which he took with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He judged that the sun had southed when at last he was
able to cross the bog and turn again to the north. The
going proved to be much better beyond the swamp. He
set out in good spirits, walked hard for half an hour to the
west, but then was stopped by another southward trending
of the lake: he had to trudge southward again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was after a couple of hours of this trudging, when he
was most tired and dispirited at having met no living soul
nor any sign of man, that he heard far off, somewhere to the
south, a single rifle shot. He shouted, hoping that the
shooter might reply: he had no reply to his hail, but the
thought, that someone was there, who might help him in
his need, and in no case could make him much worse than
he was, made him turn in that direction, shouting at intervals
as he went. Perhaps two minutes after he had set
out towards the place of the shot, he judged that he smelt
smoke. He had but one whiff of it and could not catch it
again: he was, however, sure that it was woodsmoke.
“There is some sort of a fire there,” he thought. “I shall
find somebody.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half an hour later, while he was hallooing, in the certainty
that he must be near where the shooter had been,
he saw a footmark in some soft earth close to a red-heart.
The red-heart had been split by age, wind or lightning: it
was exuding a bright blue fungus from the split. This
brought him to a halt with a start, for the footmark was
his own. He had halted just beside that tree when the
smell of the smoke had come to him. There could be no
doubt of it; he had noticed tree and fungus too nicely to
be mistaken. There was besides, the footmark, unmistakably
his. He was too wise to have false hope about
it: he had been walking in a circle: he was bushed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There it is,” he said, “I am bushed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the words were spoken, there came into his mind the
memory of Tencombe at teatime during the last summer
holidays. There was his mother with the sun upon her
hair and her alert, decisive way: there was old Bill standing
near the mantelpiece, holding his tea-cup, while with one
foot he rolled over the retriever pup. There at the table
beside the rest of them was a little frail, pale-faced, red-bearded
man, with a whispering voice, who had been
bushed in East Africa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His words came back into Hi’s mind. “If you lose your
head when you’re bushed, you’re done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll bet that that is true,” Hi said. “If I lose my head,
I shall be done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat still for some minutes, trying to keep control of
himself by repeating the things in his favour. “I have
had food to-day: and still have some plums: it isn’t
raining: I can’t be far from a camp or at least a place
where hunters come, because of that shot: whatever
wrong tracks I’ve taken, I can’t be far from the edge of
this forest: whatever happens I must not give up hope,
because ‘hope brings healing.’ I shall get out of this
mess if I believe I shall. I do believe I shall. I believe
that if I climb one of these trees, I may be able to see out
of this forest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thought fell like light into his mind, that he might
see out of the forest; but it was not easy to find a tree
which would both yield a view and be possible to climb.
After some search he came to one that seemed perfect. It
had the look of a red-heart, but was so swathed with tough
creeper, which gave good hand-and-foot hold, that the bark
was almost hidden. Hi set himself to climb. He discovered,
before he had gone far, that the creeper stalks
were bristly, like ivy or nettle stalks at home, and that the
climb was hard work. “I’m weaker than I was,” he
thought. The dust, dead twigs and fragments of bark fell
over his face and down his neck, but he persevered, even
when he roused up a gang of black tree ants. He came out
through the dimness of the roof into a sea of flowers of
every colour in a blaze of light, beset by birds and butterflies.
All that he could see was a sea of flowers, running
up into crests of greenness, topped here and there by
spikes, pinnacles and fountains of strange leaves. There
seemed no end to it in any direction, nor any break, for
even the water was hidden by the trees. It glittered and
glowed: it hummed with life: it exulted with an ecstasy
of life: it lived thus in the sun all day, and at night the
moon and the stars gave it the shadow of a life and the
peace which man never has. It was all marvellous, but
it had nothing to do with man: men did not come there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After he had clambered down, he turned away towards
the west, taking sighting marks, from tree to tree, to stop
any more going in a circle. His hands were tingling from
the creeper bristles, as though he had been pulling nettles
with them. His face was tingling in a somewhat different
way. It smarted as it had smarted years before at school
when somebody had kicked a wet Rugby football hard
against his cheek. The smarting spread down his neck to
his chest and along his backbone. He rubbed the smarting
skin, but the rubbing did it no good: it made it slightly
different and worse. In about an hour, he felt a puffiness
about his eyes: his lips and fingers had a tight feeling.
“I’m swelling,” he said. “I must have been on one of
those poison trees. If this gets much worse, I shan’t be
able to see: I shall be all puffed up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In another hour, his eyes had become so swollen that he
could not see clearly; all his face had swollen till it no
longer felt like flesh: it drummed within with a drumming
which seemed to beat upon his brain. His hands were so
puffed that he could not bend his fingers. When he came
to a puddle in the wood, he peered down to look at himself
in the water. He could not see all, but he made out
a bladdery appearance which frightened him. “I’ve
gone just like the bladders we used to suck to make elastic,”
he thought. “If one of these blisters bursts, I shall be
done.” He sat down, trying not to be frightened. “I’m
going to be blind,” he thought. “It will probably pass
off in a few hours, but I shall be blind while it lasts. I shall
be blind to-night: all to-night and perhaps to-morrow:
and I don’t know where I am, nor how I am to get out of
here. I’ve been a pretty rotten messenger, so far. Oh, I
wish that this beating in my brain would stop.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It did not stop: it grew louder, with a rhythm which did
not vary for an hour together: it beat like a heart-beat:
after a while there was something almost pleasant in its
recurrence. Then, suddenly, it changed to another
rhythm, which was not like a heart-beat, but much more
exciting. Hi was afraid to hope: he stood still, listening.
“I know what it is,” he said at last, “it is a kind of a mine-stamp,
or engine of some sort: not far away. There is
probably a mine here. I’ve wandered into Meruel, where
the mines are: this is one of them. And I am going
towards it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hope came back into him as soon as he was certain that
the noise came from men. Even Reds would be better
than the forest. He went on towards the beating noise,
which presently died away so that he scarcely heard it.
He went forward, praying that it might not cease. The
light was fast going from the forest (from sunset, not from
his blindness); he longed to be with his fellow men before
the night set in. He shouted from time to time. Presently
the multitudes of the homing birds drowned the beating
with the noise of their wings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the wings were at last quiet, the noise of the
beating reappeared above the lesser noises of night. It was
beating now in a different rhythm, with a louder volume.
“It is not an engine,” Hi said. “I know what it is now.
It is one of these tom-toms or native drums, like the one at
home, which father used to let us play. I was an ass not
to recognise it before. It must be near at hand, too. I’ll
shout again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No answer came to his shouting: the drummer, if it
were a drummer, was intent upon his rhythm, which was
taking his soul up great spirals of recurrence into the
ellipses of escape: what were night, nature and a lost
human being to him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, amid much that was indistinct, Hi saw a light
among the trees. A little fire was burning there, though
often obscured by things moving in front of it. “It is a
camp fire,” Hi thought. “And it must be an Indian camp,
because white men would never permit this drumming.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some little fear was in his mind lest the Indians should
be hostile. He had heard that the forest-Indians were
sometimes made dangerous by white criminals who found
refuge among them. Still, even cannibals would hesitate,
he thought, before killing meat suffering from poisonweed.
“I believe that they will give me a square deal,”
he said. In bursts, amid the constant noise of the
drumming, he heard the voices and the movements of the
people of the poblacion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He called several times more. Now he was heard, for
the dogs of the camp began to bark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few minutes he came into a compound, or cleared
space surrounded on three sides by Indian huts of the
kind familiar to him from his father’s tales. Fires were
burning upon stones in all the huts: by their light he could
make out men in white and things like white cloths inside
the huts. Some little dogs were at the doors barking.
There was a splashing noise not far away. Men were talking,
women were crooning to their babies, the drummer
went on drumming. Somebody was thudding at something:
it sounded like the beating of a wad of wet linen
with a mallet. Strange things like minute devils came out
of the huts, mocked at him and sidled softly away: he
could not imagine what they were. The linen-thudder
began to intone a thudding song of a melancholy kind, such
as a dog in despair or affected by the moon will sing. The
air was full of the smell of food, burning gums and sweet
oils.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am English. I am a friend,” Hi called. “Don’t
shoot. I am English.” He called this several times before
anyone paid any attention to him. Then an Indian man,
dressed in white, came from one of the huts towards him.
He was a chubby little smiling man, grey-haired, cheerful
and kind. He spoke to Hi, in words of one syllable in a
tongue which Hi had not heard. He stared at Hi’s face,
raised his hands and said, “Mar, Mar,” which Hi took to
be Indian for “You have a swollen face.” “Yes,” Hi
answered, in English, “I have indeed: trés Mar.” The
Indian surveyed Hi from head to foot, which seemed to
convince him that Hi was pretty Mar over all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A coarse voice, from one of the huts facing Hi, called out
an order to the Indian, who ceased in his pantomime of
sympathy as though he had been stung. He seemed to
invite Hi forward to enter the hut from which the voice had
called. Hi went forward, with the Indian at his side,
towards the hut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hut, like the other huts of the poblacion, was, at a
guess, thirty feet long by fifteen broad. The end, which
faced Hi, was open to the night: at the sides the roofs came
down almost to the ground, with a tiling of palm leaves
stitched with bast. The end of the hut was lit by a fire
arranged among stones, which Hi could not help noticing
were hewn stones. Someone was moving about beyond
the fire: he called to the Indian some order, that Hi was
not to come any nearer till the Indian had reported. When
this had been done, the guide led Hi into the hut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi could see across the fire a biggish white man, dressed
in a shirt and riding breeches, with a bandolier cartridge
belt. This man at the moment was bent at the fire lighting
a twig, with which he soon lit a clay lamp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, that’s lit,” he said. “Now, let’s have a look
at you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He held up the lamp and surveyed Hi with a strange
expression, which Hi could not read. He was a strongly-made,
rather tall, robust man, with yellowish dead coloured
hair, like brass-work smeared with oil. He was clean-shaven,
even in that wild place. His eyes were grey-blue
in colour. His nose was small and straight save for a
defiant tip. His mouth had about it a look of defiance,
scorn, contempt and utter fearlessness. He was without
doubt an Englishman of about twenty-five years of age
who had at one time lived among people of refinement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So,” the man said. “And where the hell do you come
from?” Hi told him his tale, that he was lost while
making for Anselmo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anselmo?” the man said. “Anselmo? I never
heard of Anselmo. Where is that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” Hi said. “In the plain: not twenty
miles from Santa Barbara. Isn’t this near the plain?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the Melchior forest, chum,” the man said.
“What the hell have you done to your face?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I got it poisoned by poison ivy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a proper new chum’s trick. You’ll be blind
to-morrow. What do you propose to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps you could let me stay here till my eyes are
better and then give me a guide to the plain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got no guide.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or put me on my way then. I can’t be far.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did anyone tell you of me, or put you up to coming
here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you come out alone into this forest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a pause at this point, while the man put down
his lamp. Hi had become used to scurvy welcomes from
the natives of Santa Barbara, but this man was a fellow-countryman
with some traces of breeding in him. The
man sat on the edge of his hammock, with his feet upon
a low wooden stool. He swung himself to and fro while he
seemed to consider.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Got any oof?” he asked at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None here. I have some in Santa Barbara.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I suppose you’ve got some in the savings bank at
home?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God,” the man said. “My God, my Father, while I
stray.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” Hi said. “If this is all the welcome you
can give me, I can go on. I am sorry if I have intruded.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you got a pack of cards?” the man asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I’ll wish you good-night,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As you please about that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi turned away, flaming with rage and self-pity at being
treated thus, in his misery, there in the wilderness, by this
fellow-countryman. He did not know where he was to
go, nor how, in that darkness and pain, but he was not
going to stop with this fellow. He moved back into the
space in front of the houses, with a sense of the comfort of
them. Each house seemed full of sheltered and fed men
and women, who had fire, rest for the night, and certainty
for the morrow, as well as companionship. He had none
of all these things: he was miles from any of them: he
was beside full of sickness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, chum,” the man called, “where are you
going?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out of this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want your carcase poisoning the bush, and putting
the game off, which is what will happen if you try it,”
the man said. He raised his voice suddenly with a call
for his Indian, who appeared on the instant, without noise
of any kind. He spoke rapidly to the Indian for a moment,
giving him orders. “See,” the man said at last to Hi,
“you can’t go with your eyes in that state. I’ve told
Chug-chug here to put you into a hut by yourself. He’ll
give you stuff for your blisters as well as some chow. Go
along with him: he’ll look after you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d better go with him, hadn’t you?” the man
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right,” Hi said. The Indian motioned to him to
follow him to one of the huts on the right of the enclosed
space. When Hi had entered the hut, which was dark,
the Indian disappeared, leaving him alone there. It was
like the other huts, closed at the sides by the roofs coming
down to the ground, and open to the air at the ends. Hi
felt utterly alone there. The tom-tom was still beating
and beating: all his blood seemed to have gone thin and
bitter from the poison in his skin. In the next hut many
people were talking together: some were singing. Then
at the door of the hut the little tiny devils appeared again:
they mocked at him and sidled softly away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently the Indian reappeared with wood for a fire
and some burning embers. With these, he made a fire
upon a hearth of hewn stones: the fire burned up so as to
light the place a little. Hi noticed a couple of tin travelling
trunks, much battered with service, against one of the
walls. The Indian motioned to Hi to sit in a white cotton
hammock, with fringes of coloured bast, which had been
slung from the posts. He sat as he was bid, with his feet
upon a long footstool of some hard wood. The Indians
brought him a mush or stew in a calabash, which he ate
with thankfulness. It was hot and seasoned with peppers:
it brought the essence of life right into his being. While
he ate of this dish, an Indian examined his feet for jiggers.
When he had finished his meal, the Indians smeared his
face and hands with a soft wet mess, which (unknown to Hi)
they had been chewing while he ate. It had a rancid smell
to it, but it soothed the pain at once. An Indian brought
him a cotton quilt for his hammock. Wrapping himself
in this, he turned in for the night: full of anxiety for his
friends, wild with disappointment at having failed them,
sick in body, and “perplexed in the extreme.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could not sleep, all weary as he was, because of the
discomforts of his body. He lay twisting in his hammock,
while the tom-tom beat in the hut beside him, changing
its rhythm once in the hour. No one seemed to want to
sleep in that village. Men and women were moving about,
talking, telling endless stories, or singing like melancholy
dogs, for hours together. Sometimes he dozed away for
a few minutes till the touch of the hammock upon his
face or hands roused him again. Always, when he woke,
the tom-tom was beating and someone was telling a story.
Little dogs, with sharp noses, enormous pointed ears and
mangy skins, came snapping into the hut from time to time,
after beetles, it seemed. The sidelong devils did not come
again: he thought of them often enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On this, the fifth day of his journey to fetch Don Manuel,
the Whites of the Western Provinces mustered 437 men
at San Jacinto. They moved out to Don Manuel’s advanced
post beyond the river, having left word that the final
rendezvous would be at San Pablo, only thirty miles from
Santa Barbara city. They brought with them many spare
horses: this was the only excellence in their force, their
weapons being mainly machetes, revolvers, rook rifles and
shot-guns of all sorts and bores with whatever cartridges
they had. There was no hesitation in any of them at the
thought of marching upon Santa Barbara. They were all
religious men, who felt that their faith was threatened.
The parish priest at San Luis, where Don Manuel was
camped, blessed them at their setting out: certainly no
man among them doubted that his going was in the service
of God.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch15'>XV</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>owards</span> three in the morning Hi fell into a deeper
sleep, from which he was roused by the cold: his
fire was out and his quilt had slipped from him.
In groping for it, he found that his head had so swollen
that he could hardly see. The pain was gone, but he was
puffed like a prize pig.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O Lord,” he moaned, “I shan’t be able to see. I can’t
see across this hut. I shan’t be able to reach Anselmo
even to-day. Now I am bound to be too late, and
Carlotta may be killed because of me.” He turned out of
his hammock to prove himself: it was only too true,
he was nearly blind: he could not hope to go on without
a guide. “Horses,” he thought. “These people have
no horses. My only hope is a river. I may be near some
tributary of the San Jacinto. If I could take a canoe
down that, or if some Indian would take me, I might even
find Don Manuel during to-day. There must be rivers
which run into the San Jacinto. If that fellow told the
truth, if this is the Melchior forest, I must be near the
San Jacinto, or its eastern tributaries. I must speak to
that fellow and beg him to help me. After all, he is an
Englishman, though he is as ross as a mule.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As it was dark and cold, he turned back to his hammock
to try for warmth and sleep. He slept a little, by starts,
always broken by nightmares. The cold struck him from
underneath: it got into all his bones. “Aha, you English
boy,” voices said to him in his dreams. “Now you’ve
come into our power you shall be searched. You’ve got
the cramps, you’ve got the aches, you’ve got the forest
fever, you are going to go blind; you’ve got the poison in
your entrails and we’re going to wring you with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he next awoke it was daylight, though still early.
The village had come again to the life it had hardly laid
down during the darkness. The thudding noise, of wet
linen being banged on stones with a mallet, had begun
again: women were singing and little brown children
were playing in the <span class='it'>patio</span>. The sharp-eared dogs had
tucked their noses into their flanks for sleep in sunny
places. The tiny devils were sidling about, mocking at
people. He recognised them now as dove-grey parrots with
rosy breasts. Their bright eyes and compact bent beaks
gave them the knowing look of men about town: they
looked like devilled-bone-and-biscuit men. They looked
at him, with their heads cocked aside, considering his
offers of friendship, and then sheered off from him as
something not to be trusted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned out of his hammock to peer from his puffy
eyes at the new world about him. His body felt as though
it did not belong to him: pains and aches had taken it
over. His face and hands felt dead: his mouth was full
of fur. He wandered out into the morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could see well enough to take a track which led
past the side of his hut to a river some twenty feet broad
where naked men and women were sitting in the water
immersed to their chins. Some women were pounding
bunches of wet cotton on the stones near the river; their
tiny children, tying minute fragments of stone to strips
of bast, were making bolases with which they entangled
the dragon-flies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After washing in the river, and bathing his puffy eyes,
Hi returned to the huts, hoping to see the white man, who
was not in his hut. Early as it was, most of the men of
the community had gone to whatever work they had to do.
Women were pounding and straining cassava, or baking it
into loaves. They laughed at Hi in a friendly way: one
of them gave him bread and a gourd full of broth. While
he ate this, sitting in a hammock, an Indian, dressed in
three tobacco-tin lids, took station before him, grinned,
pointed to his chest and said: “Me Johnny God-dam.”
Unfortunately, this was all the English known to him. Hi
tried by signs to find out where the white man was, where
one would come out if one were to follow the river, and
where the white settlements were. His performance
roused great interest, but nobody understood it: he had
the general impression that they thought that he was
praying for dry weather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went back to the hut where he had passed the night;
he was full of anxiety and helplessness. Chug-chug,
if that were his name, appeared with some aromatic leaves,
which he rubbed gently on Hi’s blistered skin, with a soothing
effect. He was a cheerful man, who talked all the
time. Hi questioned him in English and by signs: this
increased Chug-chug’s flow of talk, without bringing any
enlightenment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I ought to go on,” Hi said. “I ought to go on.
Yet what is the sense of going on, blind as I am, when I
don’t know where to make for? See here, Chug-chug,”
he said, with signs to represent the white man, “when will
the Señor, the chief, come back into the camp?” Chug-chug
knew that an important question was asked, but he
could not understand it; he made a speech about the new
cassava patch, which Hi could not understand. Having
thus made the honours even he disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll wait till mid-day,” Hi thought. “The white man
will be back at mid-day. Father always said that the forest
practice is to eat at mid-day and then take siesta. After
siesta, I shall be able to go on. The man’s a regular rossy
tick: yet even a rossy tick will tell a fellow the way. And
the more I think of it, the more sure I am that I shall be
able to reach the San Jacinto River from here. I may
even reach Don Manuel to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood at the hut door for a few minutes gazing at the
scene of primitive life before him. The sun, blazing down
into the compound, put new life into him: he felt both
warmed and comforted. He was beginning to see a little
better out of both eyes, and found that he could now bend
his fingers. One of the best of his symptoms was the feeling
that if he were to lie down he would sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went into the hut, with a sudden curious sensation
that somebody had been in the hut, behind him, until the
instant of his turning to come in. “Strange,” he thought.
“It is this puffiness of my eyes. Or I know what it was,
coming into the gloom out of the glare, made me think
that the posts were a man.” He turned back to make
sure of this. “I suppose that that is what it must have
been,” he thought. “It did look rather like a man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat in his hammock, trying to think how much he
was to blame for going astray. Then his thoughts turned
to the Englishman. “What is he and what is he doing
here, and why is he so sour? He must be a prospector of
sorts: he is not an engineer, for he hasn’t any engine.
He won’t be only a hunter or explorer: he’s too much of
a swine for that. I wouldn’t mind betting that he is a
gold or mineral prospector, who has come on a good thing
out here and is afraid of some other person cutting in on
him. That is it, I’ll bet any money. That would explain
his being so crusty and giving me so poor a welcome. I
wonder what the man is. I suppose that those are his
trunks, over there against the wall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trunks were the usual, small, flat, tin, traveller’s
trunks, made low, so as to fit under bunks at sea, or lie
snugly along the side of a mule. They had once been
japanned black. Hard service had worn away much of
the japan: some of the tin shewed bright, the rest was
battered and discoloured. On the top of the lid of one of
them was the letter D in what had once been white paint:
on the top of the lid of the other was most of the letter W.
Both trunks had been neglected for some time. Sprays of
creepers, which had thrust under the roof there, had grown
right over them. “D and W,” Hi repeated. “A letter
has been blotted out on both boxes. I suppose the man’s
name is D .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. W .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Dirty White, or Dingy Welcome,
or Doubtful Wanderer: the initials might stand for any
of them. They look like the sort of box a prospector would
take. Meanwhile, I should be the better for some sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned into his hammock, hoping that a rest would
help to heal his eyes; he saw the dog at the hut door nuzzle
further into his flank; then his overwhelming weariness
pressed down upon him so that he slept unheeding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He woke some hours later with the feeling that someone
was in the hut wanting to speak to him. It was not easy to
thrust aside such folds of sleep; while he struggled with
them, the someone, whoever he was, had gone; there was
no one there when he awoke. “Strange,” he said. “It
seemed as though someone were there. I thought that I
saw someone, a tallish chap, who had something to say. I
suppose I dreamed it. I wish that sleeping in this land
didn’t give one this thick sort of brown taste in the mouth
whenever one wakes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned out to stretch, feeling stunned and stupid,
but the better for his rest. “I’ll see if the D. W. fellow
has come back,” he thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found that the village was taking the siesta; he had
slept into the afternoon; the village was more silent than it
had been at any hour of the night. He called at the door
of the white man’s hut. “Are you there, sir? May I
speak with you?” As he had no answer, he peeped in;
the white man had not returned. “Still away,” Hi
thought. “What a nuisance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had the feeling that he must not enter the hut while
the owner was away. None the less, he looked curiously
at the contents of the hut. Some clothes of a yellowish
drill were hanging from one of the posts, with a leather
belt on which the initial D was marked in black. At the
back of the hut, beyond the hammock, was a table, made of
two planks supported upon the taller sort of Indian stools,
of the kind cut by them for their god-houses. This table
was heaped with objects, which seemed to be mostly stones
or lumps of ore; he could not make out what they were.
Under the table was another tin box marked D W upon
the side; this box was open and contained boots. The
hammock had a good brown camel-hair blanket rolled up
across its foot. Hi had just such another in his kit at
Santa Barbara: his mother had chosen it for him, “For
your father says the nights can be very cold, even a month
after the rains.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There seemed to be nothing else worth notice in the hut,
except the usual canvas water bottle, holding a gallon, a
canvas bucket with a laniard spliced into its rim, and a
canvas basin in which D. W. had soaped himself that morning.
Hi had experience of the things bought for outfits;
he noticed that all these things were very good of their kind
but the worse for wear. “No tools,” Hi thought. “He has a
working or a claim somewhere near; the tools will be there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” Hi said to himself, “I must not spy upon this
man. I wish that he would come back, so that I could have
it out with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He walked into the compound, where he passed an hour
trying to make friends with the parrots and the little dogs.
Both were gentle yet suspicious; he had no success with
them. The day dragged heavily over him, while he waited
for D. W. to return. The village was interesting and the
forest beautiful. He longed to be out of both, going fast
upon his mission, while there was still hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a while, he felt within himself the suggestion that
there might be something of interest in the hut where he
had slept. He had not examined it thoroughly; now that
his eyes were so much less swollen, he felt that that would
be something to do; there might even be some book tossed
aside somewhere. He had seen no trace of a book in
D. W.’s hut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the furthest corner of his hut was a small rubbish
heap. He pulled a half-burnt piece of wood from his fireplace.
With this, he began to poke aside the rubbish, to
see what he could find. The rubbish was of all sorts, much
the worse for having been in a corner of the hut into which
the rain had blown. He found these things:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Part of a canvas sack, into which the ants had worked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A briar pipe, much used, which had a bleached look from
exposure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Part of a leather strop that had been cut through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three small twists of tough galvanised wire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Four bits of old bootlace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A broken strap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A screw eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A paper, containing a mouldy empty cardboard box for
Marcham’s Patent Trouser Buttons, with the legend,
“No more sewing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Most of a pair of drill riding breeks made in Taunton.
The ants had been in these. Two envelopes, or parts of
envelopes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sodden little fat book, rather like a newly-drowned
puppy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He brought this book into the light, so that he might
examine it. It proved to be a dumpy volume of Milton’s
poems, complete in itself, “printed 1828 for J. Smith, Bookseller,
193, High Holborn,” and bound in green cloth
boards. It opened at the frontispiece, of Milton “from an
Impression of a Seal,” opposite a vignette of Eve among
some dahlias beside a very wriggly snake. On the flyleaf
of the book was an inscription in faint ink in the handwriting
of a woman:</p>

<div class='lgc' style='margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>To Dudley Wigmore,</p>
<p class='line'>from his Mother. &nbsp;&nbsp;August 12th, 1881.</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“Dudley Wigmore,” Hi said. “D. W.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. So that is
the fellow’s name, is it? It is an odd book for him to have.
And he might have been a little more careful of a gift from
his mother, one would think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The book was swollen and stuck together from being
soaked; Hi opened it in the sun, with great care. He knew
little, certainly, about Milton, except that he had written
a poem called L’Allegro, which Hi had had to learn by
heart some years before at his prep. school. “I daresay
I’ll like it better now,” he said. “Anyhow this is a book,
and a very famous book: there must be something in it.
And it will be something to do to try to dry it without
pulling out the leaves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After he had opened the book to dry, he went back to look
at the rubbish heap for more treasures. He found nothing
more in that heap, except some rags which the ants and
grubs had riddled to pieces. He looked at the two bits of
envelope, both of which bore English stamps. On one of
the stamps part of the postmark could be made out
when the paper was held to the light. Hi read the name
“allet.” He tried to think of some English place with a
name which ended in “allet”: he could think of none.
“It sounds liker a French name,” he thought. One of the
pieces had been addressed to</p>

<p class='noindent'>The rest was torn off. The other, which was smaller, had
only a bit of the flap, the stamp, and the ends of an address,
in a different hand, thus:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi dropped the bits of paper on to the heap. Some of
the leaves of the Milton were now dry: he turned them, so
that others might dry. Having nothing else to do, he
brought out the stools from his hut, rested the book on one,
sat on the other, and passed some hours, reading bits of
the poem as the leaves dried. The Indians looked at him
with curiosity and fear, thinking that he was practising
magic. His mood and that place gave the poetry a value
which it had not held (for Hi) in the prep. school. “When
my eyes are better,” he thought, “I will read this all
through. It is a wonderful thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day passed thus hour by hour with no sign of the
white man. Some Indians who had come to the poblacion
with cassava, brought out some stew for Hi with a piece of
hot bread, which he ate. Having eaten, he brought the
stools and the book into the hut where he had slept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is strange,” Hi said. “Whenever I come into this
hut I have the feeling that there is somebody here. It is
the way that this hammock-post catches the light.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun was now fast dropping behind Melchior, so that
it lit up the end of the hut where the rubbish had been
thrown. Something sparkled on the floor beyond the
rubbish. Hi picked it up. It was a little gold locket
clipped to a rusty steel watch-chain. After wiping the
locket, he opened it, with some trouble. It contained a
tiny photograph, not so big as his thumbnail, of a young
woman’s face. She was a handsome young woman, of the
hawk brunette type.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose that this is his girl,” Hi thought, closing the
locket. “He must have dropped this somehow in the
dark; he’ll be glad to have it again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He dropped the locket on to one of the wooden stools,
so that he might have it at hand when D. W. returned;
then he sat in his hammock, thinking of Carlotta. “Early
to-morrow,” he thought. “Early to-morrow, whatever
happens, I shall get away from here. Even now, with
luck, I might not be too late. But I simply must not be
too late. I must be in time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the light suddenly passed from the world at the
dropping of the sun behind Melchior, he wondered whether
after all he would be in time. It was hard to say what
might have happened under a madman like Don Lopez.
Supposing that the worst had happened? Supposing that
he were not in time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was weary from the hardships of the journey, all his
body was crying out for rest. He edged himself into his
hammock, for the comfort of lying prone, and there fell
asleep. He slept heavily, having still some arrears to
make up, and yet, for all its soundness, his sleep was
troubled with the sense that all was not well. Gradually,
as his sleep weakened, he began to feel that there was an
unhappiness, or something worse, close to him: someone
in distress was there. “Ah,” he answered in his sleep, “it
is you, Carlotta. All right, I’ll do my best to warn him
and bring him. I’ll do my best, though I do seem to have
muddled things.” Then, as his sleep weakened still more,
he knew that it was not Carlotta who was there, but a
man who had been there before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he said, in his sleep, “there was a man in the hut
this afternoon: so he is here again; well, what can I do
for him? Where are you? Let’s have a look at you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He struggled out of his sleep to a knowledge of the waking
world, which came upon him slowly, as another world, that
had taken its place, moved away in fiery mist. He saw, or
thought that he saw, the man standing near the hut
entrance, looking at him, with sad eyes. “All right,” Hi
cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it supper-time? I’ve been asleep, but I’m awake.
I’ll be up in one moment.” As he blinked and sat up, the
figure faded away into the darkness behind it, which was
now a blackness of leaves moving against stars. “It was
only a dream, after all,” Hi said. “But it is odd how there
always seems to be a man here. I suppose one gets to
imagine these things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came back fully to the world of the village, where now
lamps and fires were burning, women singing and the tom-tom
drumming. “I’ll see if D. W. has come back,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was prevented by the entrance of Chug-chug, who
came to ask him by signs to come to the other hut. “D. W.
is back, then,” he thought. “Now for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He followed Chug-chug to the other hut, which was lit
by three lamps. A trestle-table had been rigged up, food
was set upon it. The man sat on his camp-chair at the
table-head, facing Hi. He had a much worn cartridge belt
slung over his shoulder: one of the pouches of it was
stamped D. W. He had been cleaning a light sporting
rifle with a pull-through and an oily feather: he now held
the rifle across his knees, and kept opening the breech and
snapping it to. Hi could see him more clearly than had
been possible to him the night before. In the main, he
felt his impression confirmed, that he did not like the man:
there was more force in him than wisdom or goodness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d better have some chow, chum,” the man said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chow was the oily, peppery meat stew, served with
cassava bread, of which Hi had already eaten twice that day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Find yourself a pew there,” the man said. He was not
a gracious host: he seemed to resent Hi’s presence there, yet
this was a kind of invitation from him to sit down and dine.
Hi pulled a stool to the table and sat down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose I’d better introduce myself,” the man said,
“like the ladies do at these receptions. Did you ever hear
of Brocket Letcombe-Bassett, the hundred yards Blue?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he is my father’s second cousin. My father’s a
clergyman, or was. I don’t know whether he’s still alive;
I don’t much care.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then are you Mr. Letcombe-Bassett?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then is there another Englishman here; a Mr. Wigmore?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wigmore? Did you know him?” the man asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Hi said. “But I found a book of his and this
little gold locket. Did you know him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, he was a prospector here,” the man said. “He
died of forest fever here a couple of years ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor chap,” Hi said. It seemed a lonely death for a
man with a mother and a lover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” the man said. “He died of forest fever a
couple of years ago. There’s a lot of forest fever here as
soon as the rains call off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were you with him when he died?” Hi asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not actually with him, no; but in at the death, yes.
I was as near as I wanted to be. Forest fever’s an easily
caught complaint.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he buried here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; or not far from here. I had the Indians to bury
him. Indian fashion, in a hole in the hut.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the hut where I am?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The hut where you are? No. In the hut in the bush
where he kicked the bucket.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were you able to let his people know that he was
dead?” Hi asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; I didn’t know that he had any people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hadn’t he letters?” Hi asked. “There are scraps
of letters in the hut; torn up. Perhaps we could piece
them together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There weren’t any letters,” the man said. “Wigmore
had no letters. I expect you saw bits of some of mine,
from my loving father: blast him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, these were to Wigmore.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” the man said. “Well, I saw none. I looked
through his things. Of course, out here, an Englishman
with another Englishman, that was the least one could do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He had a girl and a mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How the hell do you know? I knew Wigmore well,
my damned young cub. As well, that is, as anyone could
know a fellow of that stamp.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know about damned and cub,” Hi said. “I’m
not your father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man stared at him for an instant with a look of fury,
which died on the instant into contempt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was talking about Wigmore,” he said. “If you
think that this is a Sunday school, you’ll learn it isn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think no such thing,” Hi said. “But I won’t take
‘damned young cub’ from a hundred yards Blue, let alone
his second cousin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The hell you won’t,” the man said. “Well, I always
liked guts, so we’ll reckon it not said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” Hi said. “As we were. I really thought
that you were Wigmore. The book was from his mother,
and the locket has a picture of his girl inside it. That was
what made me think that he must have people alive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was a very odd fish, Wigmore,” the man said. “He
was a man under a cloud. When you come to one of these
solitary men, prospecting in a place like this, you may
always be sure that there’s something wrong. He never
talked about his past; but he let you see he had one. He
drank like a fish, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he ever find any gold?” Hi asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was one of these pleasure-miners. They always
get enough to pay their Indios and keep themselves in
cartridges. They go brown after a bit; that is, they turn
Indian.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time, he had slung his rifle by its bandolier to
the crutch in the post. Hi could see the initials D. W.
burned upon the stock: it had been Wigmore’s rifle in the
past. Hi was uneasy at the way the man spoke about
Wigmore: he wished to know more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a pretty awful end,” Hi said, “to die out here
in the wilderness, all those thousands of miles from home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damned sight better end than being poisoned by
doctors in a frowsy hospital.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish we could make out enough bits of letters to
find out where his people are,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There aren’t any letters, I told you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are bits of letters, because I saw them. Do you
know, there is one way we could find out about him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?” the man asked, with a sudden close attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From people in Santa Barbara. He had a letter
addressed to him in the care of a French firm in Santa
Barbara. I expect that they were his agents. There
can’t be more than two or three French houses in Santa
Barbara. I could enquire at them all, and through them we
could easily find out where he came from.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Agents? A French firm?” the man said. “You mean
Chardenal? It is a general stores in Santa Barb’. He
used to get his stores there. They weren’t his agents:
he was a customer there. As a matter of fact, I sent an
Indio in with a chit to them when Wigmore died to cancel
his last order. They know that he is dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t they know where he came from?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was a very dark horse, Wigmore. He never told
that to me, in all the months we were together. I don’t
see why he should have told his grocers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you don’t know any English town with
a name ending in ‘allet,’ do you?” Hi asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Allet?” the man said, suspiciously. “No, I don’t
know any bally ‘allet.’ If you’d ask my opinion, I should
say you were getting Wigmore on the brain. Are you
sure you’ve not got a touch of forest fever? It often
begins like that: getting excited about somebody’s bally
corpse and that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not excited about him,” Hi said. “Only it is
rather rough on his mother and girl, if they are wondering
about him, and hoping to hear from him all this time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As I said before,” the man said, “I don’t believe for
one moment that he had a mother and girl. In all the
months I knew him I never knew him mention them nor
have any letter from them. Put him out of your mind.
He was a dark horse and a tank. It’s my believe that he
was wanted for something: anyway he was under a cloud.
Now about yourself: you say you want to get to Anselmo?
Is that near Santa Barbara? Well, if it is, it’s seventy
miles from here; and here is twenty miles from any road
there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could you let one of your Indios guide me to the road
there, early to-morrow?” Hi asked. “My eyes are well
enough. The swelling will probably be quite gone by
to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I couldn’t, to-morrow,” the man said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not? I’d be ever so much obliged if you
would.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I couldn’t send an Indio to-morrow: he wouldn’t go if
I did: it will be one of their moon-feasts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then; why not to-night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not fit to go to-night: besides, these Aracuis
won’t move a step at night. I don’t blame them. The
snakes are abroad. Then there are tigers. Besides, there
are too many ghosts for them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would chance the ghosts,” Hi said, “if you would
direct me on my way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would never find your way,” the man said. “I
couldn’t hope to show it to you in a first quarter
moon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you show it to me to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I’ll show it to you to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Early; first thing? Would you mind starting early,
so that I may reach the road before dark?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll start fairly early.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you tell me what you are?” Hi said. “I mean,
what you do out here in the wilderness?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I?” the man said. “I’m one of the damned lost souls,
who like my own way and mind my own business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly,” Hi said. “I didn’t mean to be inquisitive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You say you haven’t any money?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you play cribbage?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not much fun playing anything without having
something on the game. Haven’t you got a ticker?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but the water’s got into it. It’s stopped.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you haven’t got a tosser?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn well on your uppers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My God, My Father, while I stray. You’d better go
and turn in, then, if you want this early start. I can’t
play beggar-my-neighbour with you, like a damned kid.
Next time you look in, you’d better bring some ooftish to
cover your cards with: your mess-bills, too, if you don’t
mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry that I’ve no money,” Hi said. “But as
for mess-bills, if you’ll tell me your name and agents, I’ll
pay what you think fair for what I have had here. Or you
can take my watch. It is a good one and nearly new:
it will go well when cleaned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll talk about bills to-morrow,” the man said.
“You’d better go and turn in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well. Good-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man did not answer. He stood staring at Hi out
of his cold, hard blue eyes: his lip was lifted in a sneer.
Hi felt that he had never yet met a man so hateful. “He
is a loathsome swine,” he thought. “A vile, taunting,
silver-ring tick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came to his hut and again had the sensation that
someone was there: this time so strongly that he called
out. “Yes, who is it, there?” before he saw that there
was no one. “It is odd,” he said, “I keep thinking
that there’s a man here. I’ve got to be all jumpy from
being in the forest; and then, this hammock-post is like a
man, and gives me the illusion every time. I wish there
were a man here, Dudley Wigmore or another; then I
might not be so dependent on this sneering devil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still raging against the man, he turned into his hammock
to think of things which did not bear thought; Carlotta
and Rosa depending on him; Carlotta’s marvellous
grace, beauty and goodness; now in gaol among blackguards
at the whim of a madman; then, himself, who
was to have saved her, all astray in a forest, all those miles
from even beginning to send word about her. There was
no sleep for one with thoughts like that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sleep would not have been easy in any case, for the
village was celebrating something, a hunt or a moon-feast:
he could not tell what. Half a dozen drums were beating.
Presently the boys of the tribe lit a bonfire in the midst
of the <span class='it'>patio</span> or space in the midst of the village. They piled
it high with wood which the women had collected during
the day. As soon as it burned well, they began to march
round it, blowing into horns of one note and flutes of two
notes: some of them clacked discs of hard wood or rattled
beans in goobies: those who could not make music, sang.
The little, sharp-eared dogs sitting on their haunches at
the hut doors put back their heads, till they seemed all
throat, and sang likewise. The babies wakened from their
sleep wailed upon high notes. The men of the tribe sang
or told stories: the women and little girls dragged wood
for the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I might be a thousand miles from anywhere,” Hi
thought. “It may take me days to get to Anselmo or
anywhere else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bonfire lit up the inside of his hut so as to shew the
tin boxes marked D and W. Since he could not sleep, his
mind turned to these boxes. “There is something queer
about this man,” Hi said to himself. “There is something
odd about his relations with Wigmore. He said something
about these solitary prospectors being always bad eggs;
well, he doesn’t strike one as being a very lofty egg. He
says he went through Wigmore’s things and found no
letters. I know that there were letters, which he pitched
on to the rubbish pile only a little while ago. He made no
effort to find Wigmore’s friends. It’s true that he says
he sent in an account of his death; yet he wears Wigmore’s
belt and uses his rifle. And then, to keep away from the
poor chap while he was ill: good Lord.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There rose in his mind suddenly the image of the forest fever,
as a grey thing without a head, a thing like a worm,
which said: “It is just after the rains now: very likely
I have put a touch upon you, so that people will leave you in
a hut till you are dead. It is a very catching complaint, the
forest fever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very likely,” he said, “very likely I have caught the
fever: in which case they’ll never know at home what
became of me: no one will ever know, except the Indians
who will bury me here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to look in those boxes,” he said, turning out
of his hammock. “Perhaps there is some map or chart,
if Wigmore was a prospector. With a map I might be
able to find out where I am and how to get away from
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pulled out the nearer of the two tin boxes from its
covering of creeper. It felt and proved to be empty save
for two small studs and a trouser button. He tipped the
box on its side, to make sure that there was no label or
address. “No further help there,” he said. “Now for
the other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second box had been used to block a hole which
the dogs had routed in the hut wall. It had been weighted
inside with a biggish hewn stone, so that the dogs should
not thrust it aside. Beside the stone were some scraps of
rubbish which Hi brought out to the light to examine.
The things were:</p>

<p class='pindent'>A buckle of a strap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two halves of a lead pencil which had fallen apart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lead of the pencil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A mouldy piece of knotted ribbon, which looked as if it
had once gone round a packet of letters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two sodden letters in envelopes, both post-marked
Shepton Mallet, the one on February 1st, the other February
8th, 1886, and addressed, “Dudley Wigmore, Esq.,
c/o The United Sugar Company, Santa Barbara.” One
of these letters was signed “from mother”: the other was
from “your loving May.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Last of all was a much-weathered, ant-eaten pocket-book,
sodden with damp and so clutched together by a
rubber band as to be liker a piece of mouldy wood than
a book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is queer,” Hi said. “These letters have been
opened and carried about in a man’s pocket. They are
dated only about thirteen months ago. Yet that fellow
said that Wigmore died a couple of years ago.” Either
Wigmore was alive a year ago, or that tick opened his
letters a year after he was dead. It isn’t likely that that
fellow could have made a mistake about Wigmore’s death.
He said ‘a couple of years.’ One could hardly go wrong on
a point of that sort. One would remember when the only
white man within twenty miles died.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then that fellow said, that Wigmore was a prospector,
a pleasure-miner, and drank like a fish. Now it’s odd that
there are none of the prospector’s things here: no pans
and sieves for washing, no scales nor any stuff for making
assays. Then if he drank like a fish, it is odd that there
are no bottles left. It wouldn’t have been easy to drink
like a fish out here; but if he drank at all he drank from
bottles, and there are no bottles nor parts of bottles.
Now father said that any forest Indian would work for a
week for a bottle, which is a very valuable possession here.
They make bottles into lamps, canteens, jewels, knives,
scrapers and arrow-heads. There isn’t a trace of a bottle
in this settlement, that I can see. So probably Wigmore
didn’t drink like a fish. Probably also he wasn’t a
prospector. Probably also he didn’t die a couple of years
ago, but a year at most. This man has been lying about
him. If he lied about his life, probably he has lied about
his death. There has been a Wigmore here; that Wigmore
is probably dead. The man who knows about his
death has his gun and cartridges, and perhaps also his
gold-claim and his mining things. The man who lies about
him has profited by his disappearance. Supposing this
man, whoever he is, this hundred yards Blue man, should
have murdered Wigmore, in order to take his things?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is this hundred yards Blue man? I’ll bet that
name isn’t his real name, but a false name given to make
me think that he is related to decent people. He is not
a gentleman nor a man of ordinary decent feeling: he is
a tick or criminal. I wouldn’t be a bit surprised if he has
murdered Wigmore. If he thinks that I think that, he’ll
probably murder me. I don’t think he’d think twice about
murdering a chap. I’ll have to be jolly careful to-morrow.
But, first, I’ll look at this book, to see if it will help at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The book proved to be little better than pulp. It had
been at one time a neat oblong pocket-book with a cover
of black leather: now the dye in the cover and the endpapers
had soaked through into the leaves, which were
stuck together and stained like crushed blackberries. In
the centre were two leaves which contained some legible
jottings in pencil in a neat handwriting. They were
seemingly columns of names. Closer examination shewed
Hi that they were lists of words in different tongues. The
left hand columns contained English words, the other
columns were the Indian words in different dialects.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a vocabulary or dictionary. A polyglot Indian
dictionary,” Hi said. “That explains what the man was.
He was one of these men who write books about the Indians,
and Indian grammars. This isn’t the hand of a man who
goes pleasure-mining. This chap was a scholar. The
only prospecting this fellow did was finding a new tribe
with a different dialect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had been standing bent over the book close to the
door of the hut, where the glow of the bonfire lit his examination.
Something told him suddenly that he was being
observed. Looking up, to his left, to the point prompted
to him, he saw Letcombe-Bassett standing at the mouth
of another hut, three parts hidden, watching him. “The
beast has been spying on me,” Hi thought, turning away.
“He knows that I think things are a little fishy: he has
been watching to see what I have been doing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thought of being spied upon made him at first uneasy,
then gay. “If it comes to spying,” he thought,
“I’ll see if I cannot lead you a dance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put the book on the shelf of the post for the night:
then he turned into his hammock, thinking uneasy thoughts
till he was almost asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was lying high up in his hammock, with his head
propped by what sailors would have called the nettles.
A faint noise at the mouth of his hut made him instantly
alert: someone had crept stealthily thither, breathing
anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes? Who is there?” Hi called.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, are you awake?” Letcombe-Bassett answered.
“I was going quietly so as not to wake you. I was afraid
you might be asleep. I only wanted to say that we’ll
start in good time to-morrow, if you feel up to moving.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To Anselmo? I’m up to moving.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know nothing about Anselmo. I can start to set
you on a road which will take you to Santa Barbara.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will do. Thank you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right. We’ll start then after an early chow. Sleep
easy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He moved across the hut entrance towards his own hut;
Hi wished him good-night. “He’s a pretty bad egg,” Hi
thought. “He is here for no good and he means me no
good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These thoughts in his brain slowly merged into the
noises of the village, which in turn grew into a night that
covered him: he fell asleep in his hammock half covered
by a quilt of cotton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On this the sixth day of Hi’s journey, the five hundred
odd men of Don Manuel’s army made their first march of
fifty miles to the eastward, so as to camp at the water-holes
at Amarga. At the water-holes, they were joined
by some seventy more men, who had either followed them,
or ridden in from the north or south. When they left
Amarga they were more than six hundred strong.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch16'>XVI</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>I</span>t</span> may have been the cold working upon a body worn by
anxieties and hardships: it may have been confusion
in a brain nine-tenths asleep; or it may have been
another thing. As he slept, Hi became aware that Dudley
Wigmore was in the hut, sitting on a box, waiting for him
to wake. He could see him distinctly; a sad-looking
man, of the middle build, fair-haired, blue-eyed, gentle
and thoughtful, yet with a clench of resolution, in mouth
and chin, which made the face memorable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m an ethnologist,” Wigmore was saying. “You
want to escape from here without fail. This is Murder
Poblacion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it?” Hi answered. “By George, did that tick
murder you? Wait a minute: I’ll be awake in a minute:
then, I’ll ask you something.” He struggled with his
sleep as he spoke, beating aside the quilt. He sat up to
see Wigmore beside him, sad-eyed, resolute, yet in some
way remote from this world. Wigmore was looking at him
with a look so sad that he could hardly bear it; he was
plainly there, in a suit of old drill, real and touchable.
Yet in an instant Hi saw the thatch of the hut wall through
the man’s body: the body was and then was not, like mist
in a change of wind: Dudley Wigmore was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By George,” Hi said. “This is Murder Poblacion. I
want to escape from here. That was pretty real. By
George, if that wasn’t a dream, I’ve seen a ghost. I believe
that that was Wigmore’s ghost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was not scared by the ghost, if it were a ghost; it
had come with too serious a warning for that. He was
thrilled through with excitement; he was pitted against
a murderer in a place twenty miles from friend or weapon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Golly,” he said. “That proves it to my mind. I’ve
no further doubt that that man murdered Wigmore: he
did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he turned out of his hammock, he saw that it was
almost dawn: the young men were mustering to a hunt.
One of them began to make a melancholy noise upon a flute,
to which the others answered by tapping upon their blow-pipes.
Women were already at work at the cassava presses
or at splitting away the twigs from the branches brought
for firing. The young men moved off into the forest:
the young women in a group moved off to bathe: the
babies, dogs, pigeons and parrots came all to life at once:
none but the grown men remained in their hammocks,
even they were smoking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go through that pocket-book by daylight,” Hi said.
“Perhaps I shall be able to make out rather more of it,
when I have the light.” He put his hand to the shelf for
the book, and found it gone: it had not fallen to the floor
nor into his hammock: it was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say,” Hi thought. “That fellow must have been
watching me last night, to some purpose. That was why
he crept to the door, that first time. When I was asleep,
he must have crept in again and bagged it from where I
put it. All right. It’s just as well to know that he is
roused. I am roused, too. But, by Jove, he’ll never let
me get to Anselmo, now that it has come to this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was standing, thinking these thoughts, with a
daunted heart, near the door of his hut, when a sentence
floated into his mind as clearly as though a voice had
spoken in his ear. “He will never let you get to Anselmo,”
the sentence came. “Look out for him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It came with the distinctness of personality from the
depths of his being to voice the thought matured there.
“It is true,” he repeated, “he will never let me go. I
must look out for him. But what am I to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had no time to think of what he was to do, because
at that moment Letcombe-Bassett appeared: he seemed to
be in a much better temper than hitherto.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you’re up,” he said. “Good. There’s nothing like
the bally dawn in these bally tropics: one soon gets into
forest habits here: they are the only ways that keep one
alive here. As soon as Chug-chug brings our chow, we’ll
pasea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s jolly good of you,” Hi said, “to see me off upon
my road.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bit,” the man answered. “Out here, an Englishman
with another Englishman, that is the least one could
do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi thought that to see a man off the premises is perhaps
the least that one can do: he also thought that the man’s
mood had strangely changed for the better since the night
before. Then he had been savage at the thought of
showing the way: now he was eager to show it. It
occurred to him that there might be a reason for this
change, and that this reason, coming from an unpleasant
nature, might be an unpleasant one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose I might reach the road before to-night?”
Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Reach what road?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The road to Santa Barbara?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that road,” the man said. “I’m not so sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you said it was only twenty miles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did I? Hell. Well, it’s more than that. But I
suppose you might reach it. Yes, if you’re not lamed
or crocked or ill you ought to reach it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And can you let me take some food and water?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d better not take those here: you’ll only have to
lug them along. No. We’ll stop at another settlement,
some miles from here, and get a swag and a gooby for you
there. Then you won’t have so much to carry. But here
is Chug-chug with the chow. I always have chocolate,
Spanish-fashion here, for breakfast. A man has to be
pretty hard up to drink maté in cold blood. I’d as soon
drink swipes at a wedding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After breakfast, the man suggested that they should start.
He had his sporting rifle under his arm and his bandolier
buckled to him. Hi kept his eyes from resting on the letters
D. W. so plainly stamped upon them. He had taken pains
to avoid any reference to D. W. He wondered, as they set
out, whether he would not come to know the contents
of that rifle during the course of the morning. He wondered
whether that was why the man had dissuaded him from
taking food and drink. “Naturally, if I’m going to be
shot,” he thought, “he won’t want to waste food and
drink as well as a cartridge. But am I going to be shot?
Does he intend to kill me? How am I to dodge it, if he
does? I can’t refuse to go with him. That would bring
things to a crisis at once. I must go with him, and look
alive and trust to my luck. The worse I expect, the better
I shall find.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man led the way out of the village, across the
river, where the Indians were bathing, to a narrow path
through a cane-brake. The set of the path was to the
south and west, which Hi knew could not be the course
for Santa Barbara.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This can’t be the way,” Hi said. “Santa Barbara
must be north and east of this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course it is,” the man said. “But this is the way.
It swings north after a bit, but anyway you have to go
west first of all, to clear the marshes. All the mountain
water which isn’t soaked up by the trees seeps out at the
foothills and makes marsh. You’d better let me lead you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lead the way, then,” said Hi. “It’s jolly good of you
to trouble.” He thought that at any rate it was jolly
good to have the man with the gun in front of him. The
path was a well-trodden, very narrow Indian track, running
irregularly between walls of high growing canes,
which glittered and rattled. They had hard golden shafts
from which pale sheaths, like corn-husks, peeled. High
up, seven feet above his head, their shoots were bluish or
seemed bluish from the sky above; while the sky in the
narrow gash above was greenish from their yellowness.
The path curved in and out, exactly as the leader of the
tribe had swerved from snag or snake long years before,
when the Indians had first gone that way. It was impossible
to keep direction after the first few minutes. The
most that Hi could say was that he never headed to the
east, because he never had the sun in his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll keep forest habits, going,” the man said. “We’ll
not speak on the trail.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi was much relieved at not having to talk. He watched
the man’s back in front of him, going on and on with the
head down. “What is the brute thinking?” Hi wondered.
“How soon he shall turn round and bowl me over? Or
what a neat job he made of Wigmore and how it can be
bettered? Or is he debating whether I’m too much of a
kid to bother about? As to that, I wouldn’t mind betting
that he’s made up his mind to do for me. The question
is, when?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was the main question; but the other questions
were not answered, they recurred continually, the question,
“Will he?” and the other question, “What can I do to
stop him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There seemed to be no likely way of stopping him. Hi’s
mind was working very clearly and weighing all likely
chances. The man was armed; he was carrying his rifle
at the ready. He was a quick man, probably trained by
years in the forest to wheel and make snapshots suddenly.
He was a strong man, much stronger certainly than Hi.
If Hi were to dart in upon him, to seize the gun, he would
certainly settle Hi without trouble; being stronger, quite
as active, much more dangerous, and in better condition.
If Hi were to lag behind a little and then turn and run
back, he would only run to this man’s village, where no one
could direct him to safety, and all would tell which way he
had taken. If he were to leap to the side into the cane-brake,
he might be lucky; he might by some miracle leap
into cover which would hide him: far more probably he
would at the first spring land in some thicket which would
hold him, like another Absalom, till his enemy could deal
with him. Even if he were not shot in the first minutes
he would still be alone in the bush, lost, not knowing
his whereabouts nor his course. He might wander for days
there without finding a way out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What I must do,” he thought, “is to wait, if he’ll
let me, till I can see some real chance of escaping, and then
take my chance: the first that comes: any way of getting
away: there’s none at present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why does he lead me all this way? We must be
three miles from the village. If he had only wanted to get
rid of me, he could have potted me long ago and put me on
an ant’s nest. Perhaps, after all, he is setting me on my way
to Anselmo or to the road. By Jove, if he is running
straight, I’ll apologise to him. But I’ll bet he isn’t. He’s
got something in his mind and the time for our settlement
hasn’t come yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went on in Indian file through the cane-brake,
neither speaking, with strange thoughts and threats passing
from one to the other, till the cane-brake gave way to a
jungle, which arched over the path, shutting out the sky.
They walked in a tunnel of greenness, pierced with slats
of glare, down which flakes of living glitter and colour
floated and soared, or sometimes paused as butterflies. Hi
looked for some place to his right side into which he could
dart for safety: no place shewed there. The man led on
without uttering a word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After half a mile of the tunnel of the jungle, Hi saw in
front of him the glare of a clearing, and at the same moment
felt or heard a call within his mind, to look to his right
side. Afterwards he decided that he heard the call as
sound and at the same time felt it within him as warning.
He looked, as the call bade, to his right side, with the sense
that that part of the wood was evil. It looked more
than usually black and joyless, being a thick cover of trees
made like stage Druids with lichens. Yet at the point
where he looked there was a space of mournfulness, in the
midst of which, upon a mound from which a foot protruded,
he saw the figure of Dudley Wigmore, as he had appeared
at the hut the night before. The face was sad as it had
been the night before: it had a look of hopeless brooding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi was quite certain that he had seen it: he looked for
one second: it was certainly there: he looked again:
it certainly was not there; though the foot was there, a
white man’s foot, in a boot. He looked to his front instantly,
just in time to catch the look of Letcombe-Bassett, who
glanced back at that moment to see what he was looking
at.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re nearly there now,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi felt that they were, but answered: “Surely not at the
road?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” the man said, “not at the road, but what we’re
coming to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How far have we come?” Hi asked. “Four miles?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Call it two and a bit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems more, in this forest,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m used to this forest,” the man said. “Do you
find it gloomy at all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Hi said. “Not when I can see the sunlight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The last bit is a bit gloomy,” the man said. “It would
be a good place for putting anyone away, if anyone were
inclined that way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose it would,” Hi said, becoming very watchful.
“I didn’t consider it in that light. I suppose you always
run some risk from Indians in a forest like this? Or are
you too much feared by the Indians?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You never know where you stand with Indians,” the
man answered. “But this is the sort of place they would
choose, if they wanted me to pass over Jordan. And no one
would be any the wiser. One would be bones in a week and
green plantation in two: undiscoverable; just like part of
the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He led the way into a space which had been cleared not
very long before by many men working together. Hi
knew that Dudley Wigmore had been murdered by this
man at the spot over which they had just passed. That
was Wigmore’s foot sticking from the grave; that was
Wigmore’s wraith dreeing his weird there. How soon
was he to be added to Wigmore’s grave by those hands
now playing upon the rifle?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There now, what do you think of that?” the man
asked, nodding ahead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was a stone temple carven with gods by some race
long since forgotten. It had been covered by jungle until
a few months before: now by many burnings, hackings
and tearings its face had been cleared and its doorway
laid open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think of that?” the man repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose it is one of these Indian temples,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” the man said, “one that hasn’t been touched.
Do you know anything about these places?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Hi said, “I’m afraid I don’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think of it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s very grand.” Indeed it was very grand, being in
two orders of colossal architecture, carven to the cornice
with grotesques of gods. It seemed to Hi to be five cricket
pitches long. It was built with a tough stone facing over
brick. Wherever trees had broken the facing, the brick
core was laid bare: they were small bricks laid in a mortar
like melted flint spread very thin. The bricks were rose-red
and seemingly as tough as stone. All the roof of this temple
was covered with trees, shrubs, plants and flowers, beautiful
exceedingly. It occurred to Hi that this was the sort of
place for which Dudley Wigmore may have come prospecting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve had the men at work at this one for some time
now,” the man said. “I’m getting it a bit clear now.
Where do you suppose the treasure would be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose the Spaniards got all the treasure at the
conquest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not from this one: they never came near this
one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll bet they did,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I know they didn’t,” the man said. “This place
was lost in the jungle centuries before the Spaniards came.
I can prove it: look here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He led Hi to the temple door, in front of which a great
heart tree had once grown. This tree had been sawn
through and removed: the near-by ground was all burnt
and scattered with its wreck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s the proof,” the man said, “that tree was
blocking the main door long before the Spaniards landed.
Count the rings in the stump.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s true,” Hi said, glancing at the countless rings.
“But don’t these tropical trees put on more than one ring
in a year?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, they don’t,” the man said. “Whereabouts inside
do you suppose the treasure is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose under the altar, wherever that would be.
But the people would have taken it with them when they
went from here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They didn’t go from here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi waited: he knew that the man wanted his help in
some way in this treasure-hunt. He would not ask any
question which might bring in or suggest Wigmore. He
was certain that Wigmore had discovered this place and
had been murdered because of it. Any knowledge which
the man had was Wigmore’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will be hard work,” Hi said, “to get inside this
place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing like the work of getting to it. The roof
hasn’t fallen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be surprised if it hasn’t,” Hi said, “with the
weight of the trees growing on it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The roof can’t fall,” the man said. “These builders
couldn’t vault a roof. That is why this place is so narrow.
The roof is of slabs of stone laid upon balks of stone. It’s
as strong as a hill. It is all enormous walls, with narrow
rooms inside them. There’s a certain amount of mess
inside, of course: these tropics sprout like sewage, but it
can be easily cleared: that is, fairly easily.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be interesting work,” Hi said, “to get inside
and see what it’s like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Interesting? I believe you,” the man said. “This
place was built by the Quetzals, whoever they may have
been. They had a picture writing of sorts and kept a
history in it. They’ve got rolls of their history in Santa
Barb’; people have been deciphering it. Nothing much
is known of them yet, for they were gone before the
Spaniards came. Now I’ve reason to believe that this
place is the great temple of the Quetzals; the Temple of
the sun, or the Temple of Gold. It was a legend when the
Spaniards came, as I expect you know: they heard of
it: they often looked for it, but they never found it; the
forest fever saw to that. Except by a sort of miracle no
one could have found it. The Quetzals were a great race:
you’ll see their cities up in Melchior; but the fever came in
and wiped them out. I believe that this old god-shop is
bung full of gold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What gold?” Hi asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gold of offerings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That would be exciting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Sacramento would be a fool to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know that they offered gold?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They offered all the gold they found, so the histories
say: thousands of pounds for hundreds of years: believe
some of what you see and a tenth of what you hear: it is
still likely that they brought a lot of gold here, and here
it is still.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will be a find.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what do you say to giving me a hand to get it?
I’ve cleared this space by the help of the Indians, but I’m
not going to have these Indians looking for the gold: not
likely. That is the white man’s perk: none of my brown
brothers in this for me: no fear: the hunting parties
would go wearing gold till the Barboes learned of it: news
soon spreads in this forest. Then we should have the
Government in. As you can see, it’s more than a one
man’s job in there, but I reckon that two could shift the
stuff and find the altar. And we’d need two to get the gold
melted down and into Santa Barb’. They buy it there,
pesos for weight, at the Assay Office. I tell you, the
Ballarat field is just footle to it. This is Tom Tiddler’s
ground, that the kids play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It sounds pretty thrilling,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thrilling? I guess it is thrilling: p.d. thrilling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m awfully keen on getting to Anselmo first,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know you are,” the man said, “I know you are. But
what is Anselmo beside what I offer you here? We
should shift our traps to here for a couple of weeks, and
after that what would Anselmo be? Why, you would
be able to buy Anselmo: buy it ten times over and all
that’s in it: miss and mister. And I’d be a lord at home
and have a bloody deer-park.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know,” Hi said. “I say, it sounds exciting.
But have you any picks and crow-bars?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, in a stone trough there: out of the way of the
ants.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose we could get done in a couple of weeks?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll have to, for the sooner we lift it the better. Not
that anyone will come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean that the fever will come down?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but these Aracuis go talking: and news spreads.
Shall we start, then? What do you say? Off saddle and
at it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to, frightfully,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, here you are then,” the man said. “I’ll give
you a third share in anything we find: very likely a
million pounds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, that’s generous. But before we start work,”
Hi said, “I’d like frightfully just to walk along the
building and look at it, from close to. I’ve never seen one
of these places before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look your bellyful,” the man said. “I hoped you’d
see sense when it came to the point. I’ll get the picks
along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man kept his eyes upon Hi, who took a pace back to
consider the front of the building. He did not see the
temple: it was all a blur of angry gods topped by a foam
of flowers and the spears of palms in a glare of light as red
as blood. He knew that the man was watching him: he
knew that the man had killed Wigmore so that he might
be alone in possession. The facts of the murder were all
bright in his brain. Wigmore, the scholar, had found the
place and cleared it. Then this man, the wanderer and
waster, had come thither, by some Fate or chance, and
had murdered Wigmore. Now that he himself had come
thither, the man wished him to help in the finding and the
raising of the treasure. If he refused, he would have a
bullet in his brain within ten seconds. If he accepted, he
would have a week’s or a fortnight’s toil: then the bullet.
If he tried to escape, what hope had he, save to wander in
the fever forest in the fever season till he died miserably or
was lost in the marsh?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll start in that door where the tree was,” the man
said. “It may not have been the main entrance, but the
stone is all worn away there by people’s feet: it is a used
entrance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” Hi said, with the words sticking in his
throat. He did not know what he was to do; there was
nothing that he could do. He felt suddenly that there
was nothing for it but to plunge into the forest, cost what
it might. “I’ll never get out of it,” he thought. “But
anything to get away from this fellow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The building faced him, running north and south across
the clearing. They were standing close together nearly
opposite the central point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, have you looked enough?” the man asked.
“You’ll have plenty of chance to look at it in the next
ten days or so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to go along the side of it once,” Hi said. “I’d
like to pace it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pace away,” the man said. “It’s 120 yards, but
you’ll want to know for yourself, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you measured it, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’d like just to pace it and see it close to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned south from the man along the line of gods to
the end of the temple, which had not been cleared of
creepers; the forest came to it and cloaked it there. He
turned here to look along the line of the building. What
struck him most was its silence, its blood-red colour where
the facings had fallen, and the fact that every inch of it
bore life of some sort. The man was watching him and
playing with his rifle; he was sitting on the stone trough
which contained the tools, much as a cat, having a mouse
in a shelterless space, will drop him, withdraw a few paces,
look at the sky and lick her fur. Hi pretended to examine
the carving: he felt that the man must know what was
passing in his mind. “I must start pacing,” he thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lifted his eyes towards the other end of the building.
Dudley Wigmore was standing there, facing him, with his
right hand upon the building, and with his left beckoning
to him to come. It was very strange: he was there and
yet he was not there: he certainly saw him: then lost
him: then knew that someone sad was there who wanted
him to go there. “Right, I’ll go,” he thought; so he set
out, pacing and counting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he came to the central door, abreast of the man,
he was hailed. “You needn’t go any further, chum. The
other half is exactly the same, another sixty yards.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to the end,” Hi said. “I believe your
figures are wrong. I believe you’re four yards out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A pace won’t beat a yard-measure, chum.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll talk in a minute,” Hi answered, still counting.
“Just a minute, if you don’t mind: I don’t want to lose
count.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went on counting mechanically, thinking of a
strangely different mark of a vanished race not far from his
home in Berkshire. Someone had told him long before
that that monument was 375 feet long. He counted his
pacing of this temple wondering if it would not prove to be
the same, and if it were the same why it should be. All
the time he was terrified, lest he should be shot in the back:
the sweat was dripping from him. Hope kept surging up
in him that he might escape: despair kept urging him to
fling himself at the man’s feet and squeal for mercy. All
sorts of thoughts, of home and Carlotta and the things he
wanted to do, seemed to be protecting him. His life was
from second to second; “eighty-one,” he was alive,
“eighty-two,” no bullet, “eighty-three,” not dead yet.
Dudley Wigmore was there: he could see his expression;
very sad, yet hopeful. Dudley Wigmore was not there;
the end of the temple was there, in a great corner-god,
helmeted in the snake and eagle, whose mouth crunched
the leg of a man. By this time he was up to the hundred.
Suddenly Dudley Wigmore was there again, showing him
the forest beyond the end of the temple: the ground was
sloping down there in a cover of greyish thorn and greenish
scrub, topped by what looked like ilex. He went on
pacing, repeating his count aloud: “a hundred and ten;
a hundred and fifteen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey, chum,” the man called. “Hold on a minute.
Wait for me a moment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Possibly he began to suspect suddenly: at any rate, he
snapped-to the breech of his rifle, rose, and began to walk
steadily towards Hi.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m just finishing,” Hi called. “I’m sure it must be
more than you make it. I make it 127 paces.” He turned
to see where the man was, measured his distance as about
fifty yards, and then quietly, as though exploring some
ruin at home, turned the corner of the building.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The instant that he was out of sight, he darted across
the end of the temple into cover: he forced his way
through the scrub, ducked well down into it so as to be
hidden, and ran downhill as he had never run. He had
gone perhaps seventy yards, head down and arms across eyes
against the thorns, when something hard took him across
the leg, just below the knee, so that he fell headlong
violently into a thicket. It was a severe fall, which
knocked all the breath out of him. He came to himself
with a pain in his leg. “I’ve been shot,” he thought,
“shot and hit in the leg.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Up above him on the plateau of the temple, he heard
Letcombe-Bassett call: “Chum. Heya, chum. Are you
there, chum?” He heard him probe at some of the near-by
cover, seemingly with the barrel of his rifle. “I’ve not
been shot,” Hi thought, “I fell over a snag.” He dared
not stir a muscle, he hardly dared to breathe: Letcombe-Bassett
seemed so near, almost looking down upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sing out, chum,” Letcombe-Bassett called. “Where
have you got to? Answer.” He listened for an answer,
and, having none, muttered a curse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You needn’t pretend that you can’t hear me,” he called
again. “You’re within a few yards: so answer: don’t
play the giddy goat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi’s heart was thumping in his throat, yet he smiled at
this order, it was so like the call of a cross seeker, in hide
and seek, in the shrubs at Tencombe, bidding the hiders
to call “Cuckoo again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now cheese it, chum: come off with this kidding:
where are you? Cut this right out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a pause after this, while Letcombe-Bassett
listened, not so much for an answer, as for some sound,
which would show him where Hi was. Hi kept still as
a stone, which was not easy, for he had fallen into an uneasy
posture, in a thicket which was the breeding or roosting
place of minute scarlet midges. These things surveyed
him for a few seconds, then, having decided that he would
be good to eat, they settled upon him. There were perhaps
fifty of them, each with the theory that the nearer the bone
the sweeter the meat. Their bite was by far sharper than
the bite of the spotted-winged marsh-midge at home. But
far worse than the bite was the pertinacity with which they
thrust down his neck, into his ears, up his nostrils, or down
to the roots of his hair, before they bit. Hi longed to beat
them from him and scratch as he had never scratched.
Letcombe-Bassett listened, making no sound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chuck it, chum,” he called at last. “I know you’re
there. You won’t kid this nigger: I’m not that sort.
You’d better come out. If I come in to fetch you, you’ll
sing a different song, my lad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seeing that threats had as little effect as persuasion, he
tried again, with an appeal to reason. “Look here, kid,”
he said, “I’m only speaking for your own good. You’ll
never find your way out of this. You’ll get bushed to a
dead cert, just as you were before. And if you get bushed
in this part, God help you. There’ll be no kind white man
to give you chow; don’t think it. If a snake doesn’t do
you, a tiger will. Or if a woods Indian finds you, he’ll eat
you: to say nothing of the fever. Come on out of it, like
a sensible kid and turn-to at the temple.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you think I’m not offering you enough, you’ve only
to say the word. I’ll go you an honest half, share and
share alike, in all we find: I can’t say squarer. I wouldn’t
do it for many people; but I like you, because you’ve got
guts, and so I tell you straight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s why Doll Tearsheet loved Falstaff,” Hi thought,
not stirring. “An odd taste, but love is blind. What will
be his next move?” Letcombe-Bassett paused to consider
and to listen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, chum,” he called at last. “I’ll remember
this. You needn’t pretend to me that you’ve got clear
away. I’m not so easily fooled as you may think. You’re
within earshot and very well within range; kindly remember
that. Are you going to come along and bear a hand?”
He waited for ten seconds for an answer, then said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll give you while I count seven: if you don’t come
before then, I’ll come in and fetch you. I know where you
are. As a matter of fact I can see you from here.” This
was thrilling hearing, though Hi believed (and earnestly
hoped) that it was not true. The man gave it a few
seconds to work upon his victim’s mind; then he began to
count.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, then: while I count seven. One. Two.
Three. Four. Five. Six. This is your last chance, I
warn you straight. Are you coming? Very well, then.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Seven. I think I may promise you that you’ll regret
this, my young friend. You’re within easy shot-gun
range, and I’ll walk you up like I’d walk up partridges. I
gave you a square deal, but you asked for trouble. Don’t
blame me, if you get it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that instant, from somewhere in the forest, perhaps
thirty yards from where Hi had entered it, a piece of a
dead bough fell to the ground, with a noise which to Hi
was exactly that of one slipping on wet earth and recovering.
To Letcombe-Bassett it gave a much-desired clue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right,” he called. “Thank you for telling me where
you are; now we’ll see. My Indians say you stink. You’ll
stink worse before I’ve done with you, my young whelp.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this he burst into cover in the direction of the fallen
bough; but as the jungle happened to be thick there, he
gave it up, went back into the open, cast about for Hi’s
marks, and re-entered at the very place where Hi had
entered. When once within the scrub, he seemed to
neglect tracks and again tried to force a passage to where
the bough had fallen. He beat the cover as he went. It
was all dry, feathery, fronded cover, sweetly smelling when
crushed, but abounding in scarlet midges. Hi heard him
slap at his cheeks and curse: he himself felt that he was
being eaten alive, yet he could not stir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” the man called. “Don’t think I’ve done
with you. You’ve not done me yet. Since I know you’re
not over here, I know you must be over there; and when
I get you, you’ll get the kibosh put on all this poppycock;
you wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man cast back along the fringe of the cover, beating
it, as far as Hi could judge, with care. The wood there was
all sage-green sari-sari plants, easy to thrust through but
confusing to see in, as the fern-like shoots grew thick to
the ground. When he had made a cast of about sixty
yards, he turned, to make a cast back, a little further into
the wood. Hi heard him come nearer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The brute,” Hi thought, “he knows something about
hunting; he’ll cast to and fro like a shuttle till he lands
right on to me. My only chance will be to trip him and
try to bag his gun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man came slowly back, searching: Hi heard him
kick at the undergrowth, shake aside boughs, slap at the
midges, and whistle between his teeth. Sometimes he
sang, in a voice no bigger than a hum, the first line of a
song:</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'>“There were three flies; three merry, merry flies.”</p>

<p class='noindent'>He would stop here, as though he knew no more of the
words, hum through the tune, or whistle it, in a groom’s
whistle, between his teeth, and then sing the refrain:
“Whack fol lol tiddly ido.” All the time, he was drawing
nearer, beating the cover; presently he was at the end of
his beat, and turning to beat back a little further into the
forest. “I’m sixty or seventy yards into the forest from
the clearing,” Hi reckoned. “He has gone roughly through
half of that. Now he’s getting really near, and this time
he may see me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man seemed to think that he was drawing near to
the quarry. “Do you hear?” he called, “you’re not
dealing with anybody; you’re dealing with me. I don’t
give up when I begin a thing: I do it. This cast or the
next you’ll be sorry, my little sucking swine.” He came
back, upon his new line, beating as before, and muttering
to himself: “Oh, not in there? No, but not far off and
not much longer. Damn these flies. If I’d a dog I’d
damn soon flush this puppy. Come on out of it, you young
swine. My good golly, I’ll take your pelt off in return for
all these midges: so much I’ll promise you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came slowly along, drawing nearer to Hi. He
seemed to take hours over each few yards of ground. Hi
understood now how it comes to pass that hunted men,
with prices on their heads, will sometimes give themselves
up. He had not come to that point yet, but it was no
longer out of his thought. The man came near to Hi,
passed him, still muttering, beating and singing, and so
slowly went to the end of his beat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now for it,” Hi thought. With the utmost care he
moved his hand, so as to smear it, for one delicious instant,
over his face: it was the only relief possible: the next
instant, he heard the man turn and come swiftly straight
towards him. Could he have heard or seen him moving?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s where you are, is it, my cock,” the man called.
“Right you are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi was tempted to leap and run for it. The words went
through him like shots; but he gripped himself, and said,
“No, this man deals in bluff; he’s bluffing now to make
me stir.” He lay still, while the man came straight towards
him. There was no song of the flies now, he was walking
with some fixed intention as though to a mark. He
stopped at about nine yards from where Hi lay. Hi could
see both his leggings and boots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now then,” the man said. “Now then, my sucking
dove; you’re somewhere just about here. I know you
must be. I’m quite content to stay here all day, waiting
till you squeal. I’ve done as much for a rabbit I’d got no
quarrel against. I’d do more for you, let me tell you.
You won’t tire me, when I’m fixed on a thing. Are you
going to surrender and ask my pardon? Well, if you won’t
answer, you’re wise; for you’re going to get a bullet in
your guts before you’re much older: you can save your
breath to squeal with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came two paces nearer through the scrub. Hi could
see the fronds of the talpas moving above him as he forced
his way through. Just beyond the talpas was a space of
earth littered with yellow fungus. “When the beast comes
on to that,” Hi thought, “he’ll be bound to see me; he
must see me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man wrestled through the talpas on to the bare
space and kicked the fungus aside. “Yellow stink-horn,”
he said. He was within six feet of Hi; he had only to
stoop to see him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then at that instant, with a sudden startling leap, somewhere
to the right of the man and behind Hi, something
big arose in the cover and ran for it. The man was prepared
for a jump of the sort: he leaped to one side with
a cry: “Ah, there you go. So you think you’ll try that.”
Hi saw him clearly for an instant, standing tense, trying to
see the leaping thing, whatever it was. Then, as he could
not see, he leaped into the covert after it, shouting, “Stop,
or I’ll plug you.” Two yards further on, he may have had
a glimpse of a quarry, for he fired, jerked out the shell,
snapped in a second shell and fired again, quicker than Hi
had thought possible. Hi heard him mutter: “Got him.
That touched him where he lived; but I’ve got to get to
him, to make sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man stood for an instant, trying to see. “He’s
down,” he muttered. “Or is he down?” The noise still
came to them of something moving: perhaps after all he
hadn’t got him. Hi heard him jerk out the shell and
snap in another. “Well, I’ll soon make sure,” he muttered.
“It wasn’t a bad shot for nine-tenths guess-work, if I did
get him. I’d have given something to have seen him cop
the spike. These stinking kids think themselves someone
at school: then they come here as though the earth
belonged to them: they have to learn what they amount
to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He moved away into the wood. Hi heard him there
beating shrubs at about a hundred yards from him. At
that distance he was not likely to hear small movements in
the bush; Hi was able to change his position to a thicker
patch of scrub and to deal with the midges. After an
hour of searching, Letcombe-Bassett became silent.
“He’s resting,” Hi thought, “or waiting for some sign.
He thinks that if I’m alive I shall think that he is gone and
get up to go; while, if I am dead, the carrion-birds or
those beastly ‘betes-puants’ will show where I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Letcombe-Bassett was in fact waiting for just those
reasons. He had nothing better to do: he enjoyed snap-shooting
and would gladly wait all day for a shot: he had
besides found cause to believe that Hi had not budged.
Presently, he came nearer to Hi and called, “All right,
son, my Indios will be here at twelve with chow. We’ll
see how you feel with some Indio trackers after you.”
This was the last threat for the time: after this he came
slowly up the hill, kicking or beating at some patches,
though not searching them as on his way down. He
passed within fifteen yards of Hi, somewhere out of sight
in the talpas and sari-sari. In a few minutes, Hi heard
him burst through a patch of crackle into the clearing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s going to wait for the Indian trackers,” Hi thought.
“Or is that just a ruse of his? I wonder how long it is
to twelve.”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch17'>XVII</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>H</span>e</span> reckoned that he had breakfasted before seven,
and had been at the ruin before nine: perhaps it
was eleven now. Almost at once, he heard the
chant of Indians and the drone of a pipe coming towards
the clearing. “My luck is out again,” he thought. “Here
are the Indians: this is where I shall stop, then.” He
heard Letcombe-Bassett hail the Indians: he was still
close to, at the edge of the clearing. Hi could hear the
goobies clatter as the men trotted across to him. He heard
the man address them, explaining what he wished them to
do; and the grunting of the Indians as they understood
and assented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was tempted to rise and run; but the memory of
the swiftness of the man’s shooting held him back. “He
would have half a dozen shots in the first half minute,” he
thought, “and then the Indians would run me down.
I’ve no chance that way; but this way I may get one bang
at an Indian, if not at him.” He squirmed down into his
patch, while the man led the Indians to the spot where he
had entered cover some hours before. “Leu-in, hounds,
eleu, ed-hoick,” the man called. The Indians came into
cover, just like hounds, and began to cast, with little cries
and ejaculations, like the whimper of hounds, feathering
yet not quite owning to it. “Ed-hoick,” the man called.
“Yooi, pash him up. Hoik to Chaunter: hoik. Hoik
to Dowsabel. Yooi, yooi, yooi; fetch him out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We all know you’ve been terrier-boy to the North
Surrey,” Hi thought with bitterness. “You need not
advertise the fact.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hounds came eastwards in a very wide cast. “It’s
a drive,” Hi thought. “They’re going to make a semi-circle,
and drive me up to the gun. He’s going to stay in
the clearing, to pot me when I break.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had not time to consider the matter, for the Indians
were moving swiftly to him, some above him, some below,
and one straight for him. They were on the work they
did best in the world. They were doing it with enjoyment,
with little quick cries, one to another. “No power on
earth can stop that Indian from seeing me,” Hi thought.
“He’s coming straight for me.” In an instant the Indian
had thrust aside the scrub, so that Hi saw him plainly.
He was a short, squat, plump young Indian brave, in a
cotton shirt; he had long black hair sleeked down with
fat; he had a gold half-moon in his nose; he carried a
spear, and bore a blow-pipe on his back. Their eyes met.
Hi had never seen him before, that he could remember. He
was a broad-faced, high-cheek-boned man, with hardly any
nose, like most of the tribe. He looked at Hi and Hi at
him for one marvellous second, in which they understood
each other. So will a man and dog meet, understand and
pass on, with no word said, yet the dog wagging his tail.
The Indian smiled and passed on, and Hi knew that it was
all right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little quick cries became a little louder, that
was all, some sort of a message passed down the line, to let
the Indians know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently the Indians moved up into the clearing to report
that the white man had escaped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their going was like the lifting of the cloud at the passing
of the line-squall. Hi knew that there had been an overwhelming
change in his fortunes, brought about by no
merit of his own, but by something fortunate that happened.
He had been upon the rack for hours: now he was suddenly
free. He cleared his face and hands of midges, though
their bites no longer seemed to matter. He rolled over,
with a sigh of delight at being alive, and fell asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes in childhood he had dreamed a recurring
dream, of a most beautiful grave spirit of a woman, whom
he knew as his “Elder Sister Ruth.” In his dreams, this
spirit sometimes came to his bed, looked at him with
eyes so beautiful that it was hard not to wake, and then,
sometimes, some blessed times, took him by the hand and
led him into the air, through the window and away, over
the tree-tops, to strange lands, or to the stars. Even if
such dreams were broken they were a joy to him:
when they were not broken he thought of them for
days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had not dreamed of Ruth for years; indeed, he had
seldom thought of her since his going to his prep. school;
but now he dreamed of her: she was there, that heavenly
spirit, calling him “Christopher,” her name for him, just
as she had called him, for the first time, in that night-nursery
at Tencombe, in the nook where his cot was, when
he had wakened (as he thought) to see her beside him, lit
by the flicker from the fire. It was such joy to see her
there, after those days of friendlessness, that the tears
streamed down his face. He knew that it had been hard
for her to come to him, and that it was hard for her to
speak; yet what use were words, she understood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment he lay still in his happiness; then, thinking
that he had not seen her for years, he gazed at her, and
found that she had not changed; but that he could see
more in her face than in the past. She had a calmness and
wisdom of beauty that was not subject to change: all peace,
courage, goodness and happiness were in her face, and a
hope so bright that no danger made a drawback.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this was joy to him for a moment, until, in his dream,
the thought came to him that she only appeared to him
in dream; that this was a dream, and that it would fade.
She smiled at his thought. “No, it is not a dream,” she
said, “look about you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marvelling, he sat up and put out his hand upon the soft
grey-green frondage of the sari-sari. That dry, feathery
touch was real: that smell of mint and turpentine from
the crushed fronds was real. The red-hearts in the glow
of the sun were real; so were those little green wrynecks
questing their bark for food. On the ground was the
broken yellow fungus, and beyond it lay the two brass
rifle-shells, with ants examining them. A little gust of
wind came down the forest, the sari-sari bowed to it and
glistened and dappled, like the grass under the wind on
Blowbury. A buck of the forest, delicate and proud,
appeared, wide-eyed as a hare, noble as a Persian prince;
he scraped with his forefoot and tossed his head in challenge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, it is real,” Ruth said. “Shall we go on, then?
We will set out together: it is not far.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O God, Ruth,” he said, “I’ve wanted you. I’ve
wanted you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She knew that, without his telling: she helped him to his
feet. The light became more glorious than he had ever
known it: all the leaves upon the trees seemed to be edged
with fire. The light upon Ruth’s face came from the beauty
of her spirit: he knew that. This other beauty was a part
of the happiness which she brought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instantly they set out through the forest side by side,
so easily that they seemed to be moving upon the wind:
the boughs gave way before them: they passed the hawk in
her ravine and the wild-cat in his range: the deer gazed at
them, but were not startled. In a glade of grass where
a brook ran Ruth stopped him, because, in the brook, was
a nest full of the eggs of a waterfowl, and in the grass were
little blue mitai berries, known as the berries of our Lady
from being ripe near Lady Day: of these he ate and took
store.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this they came to a jut of earth on which a dead
tree stood with its roots exposed. Many mice in their holes
here watched him with little bright eyes. At the foot of the
jut was a shrub with hard, thick, dark-green leaves, and
a rough bark, seamed with fibres like veins, as fragrant as
incense from creamy gum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put this cream upon your face and hands,” Ruth said,
“then you will not feel the bites of the insects.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smeared himself as he was bidden and instantly the
burning in his skin was soothed. He saw Ruth gravely
considering him with eyes so beautiful that he felt that he
could not bear their gaze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you be always with me?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Always.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” he said, “if you would help me to save Carlotta,
who is in danger and trusting to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is in no danger,” Ruth said, “but the trumpets
are calling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As in a dream, the words “the trumpets are calling”
seemed fraught with meanings from beyond the world.
He gazed at Ruth, as though by gazing he would come to
a knowledge of the truth. He saw, as it were darkly, a
confusion of men doing terrible things to each other while
the trumpeters blew. Then all this cleared away, he beheld
nothing but Carlotta in white, looking upward, with a look
of happiness such as he had never seen, save on Ruth’s
face. Behind her, he saw the pinnacles of a church,
glittering, as he thought, from the light catching the
crockets, until he saw that the glittering was from winged
spirits exulting in such beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not as man thinks,” Ruth says, “but as God wills.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt the scene merge again into a dimness, so that he
could not see, only feel, that he was moving away again,
with Ruth near him, over country which would have been
difficult but for her presence. She led him through
thorns, which he never felt and through waters where
she bare him up. Once, after the endless way, he would
have sunk, had she not sung to him, as once before at Tencombe,
a song so beautiful that it was as though the world
were singing. What happened to him in these hours he
never knew, save that he was miraculously helped: in a
sense, those hours were as though they had not been: in
another sense, they were among the intensest hours of his
life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was after three o’clock in the next afternoon when he
came out of the wood into the plain of San Jacinto. The
forest ceased, the light became stronger suddenly: then,
instead of the waving gloom stabbed with glare, he saw the
plain, going on into the north in rolls of freedom: he saw
the homes of men and heard the lowing of cattle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon he came to a road running east and west; he
turned to the east along it, till, at a wayside cross, he sat
down, wondering whether he could go any further: the
world seemed to be swaying beneath him and in front of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half an hour later, a horseman hove in sight, closely
followed by a three-horsed brake full of men and women,
who were singing to a mandoline and a reed-pipe, under an
awning of green and white stuff. The rider saluted Hi
as he passed, then, being struck by his appearance, which
was that of a corpse and a scarecrow combined, pulled up
and caused the brake to halt. Some of the men dismounted
and asked Hi, in Spanish, what was the matter. A plump
and pale young woman, with eyes like big black plums,
came down to look at him. Hi heard them decide that he
was English and a caballero; but, then came a discussion
of the question: how had a caballero gotten into this
pickle?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where you been?” the girl asked, in English. “In
the forest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lost?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay de mi. For how long?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dios mio. He had been lost in the forest. Regard the
mud: see also the thorn-marks and the bitings of bichos.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Always some are lost in the forest: they go blind, then
they go mad. They will drink fire, thinking it water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Remember that man of Matoche: he who had nothing
but a book.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Also that other: the Americano: for whom some
Americana must still mourn. He had her locket, the poor
man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And this is but a boy and a caballero.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and very gentle,” the girl said. “His manners
are so modest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned to Hi, and spoke again in English. “You go
San Marco?” she asked. “We take you to San Marco?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that near Anselmo?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Near where?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anselmo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This the girl did not know: she repeated it among her
friends, who all seemed puzzled. Then one man said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anselmo?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Si,” Hi repeated. “Anselmo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Si,” the man said, with a swift jabber of assent and
explanation to the company. “Anselmo.” He seemed
to add that it could be reached through San Marco.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” the girl called, “you get Anselmo there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not very tidy for riding with you,” Hi said, shewing
the wreck of his clothes, torn in forty places and mired to
the throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That doesn’t matter,” the girl said. “Can you climb
up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could not climb up; he found that he could hardly
stand. The girl and one of the men helped to steady him on
his feet; then the men in the brake got hold of him and
heaved him in, with cries of:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Welcome the stranger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since thou mayst be Jesus, welcome: yet if thou
beest not, welcome.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl, who had spoken English, made room for him
beside her, and as the brake drove on, she put her arm
round him and called him, “My dear.” She had been
drinking a little, but she was a very good young woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I talk English, my dear; I love the English: some
of them, what? We had two English in our house. Mr.
and Mrs. Watson; do you know them? To-day, we been
to a wedding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here one of the musicians handed her a wicker-covered
blue glass liqueur-bottle with a tin measure which could be
screwed over the stopper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t Paco dreadful?” she said. “First we had wine:
then we had brandy: now he’s going to give us all the
Milk of Venus. We shall all be drunk, Paco.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, not for you,” Paco said. “But for the Englishman.”
They gave Hi a swig of the Milk of Venus, which
revived him wonderfully: then they took swigs of it themselves
till it was all gone: then they threw the bottle at
Uncle Philip (as they called the rider), hit his horse on the
crupper and made him buck. The plump young woman
was very kind; she put her arm a good deal more tightly
round Hi and said that she did love stars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know, stars in the evening: they’re so like
angels.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi said that she was like an angel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A bit fallen angel; I don’t think: what?” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man with a mahogany-coloured face, “rather like a
frog,” Hi thought, since his eyes turned up and his face
was all going to throat, began to sing a doleful ballad, with
a chorus in which all joined. As all felt better after this,
one of the other men sang a song which went with great
spirit, though it made the ladies blush. As he was pleased
with its reception, he sang all the blushing parts of it a
second time. Then the frog man produced a bag from
under the seat: it contained three small bottles with
brightly coloured labels showing ladies of a free disposition.
The labels were printed with the words: “Smiles of the
Muses.” There was much applause in the brake when
they appeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha. Smiles of the Muses. Three bottles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha, the good Hernando, who knows what is good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Always the good Smiles of the Muses, to drive away
care and settle what went before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The brake pulled up by the wayside, so that no Smile
might be spilled. The good Hernando dispensed something
like a quarter of a bottle to each of the company.
It was a syrup or cordial, about as thick as olive oil. It
smelt, when opened, of all the flowers of heaven. At a
first taste it reminded one of strawberries and of honey:
then it warmed the throat: then, as it trickled along, it
made a feeling glow all the way down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the brake drove on again, the mandoline struck
up a Smile of the Muse: the reed-pipe piped to it and the
company sang. The song had not much body to it, being
indeed a catch about the eyes of a lady being as lovely as
stars. It went on, during some miles of the way, till in the
dusk of the evening the brake halted in San Marco, which
was a town of six farms and a chapel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here, as weary as Hi was, he noticed that something
had happened: someone had come in with news which
brought all the town out of doors. When the news reached
the wedding party, it changed their tone. The younger
men hurried off to the group about the messenger, who
stood on the chapel steps answering questions. The frog-faced
man, the good Hernando, helped Hi down from the
brake. Uncle Philip and the girl urged him to enter a
lime-washed farm-house, with a smell of wine-press about
it near which the brake had stopped. Hi was so dizzy with
fatigue that he hardly knew what he was doing, yet he
shrank from bringing his filthy state into a clean home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You come to the harness-room,” Uncle Philip said,
through the girl, “for a bath, and to get out the thorns
and jiggers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They brought him a half-cask and hot water: after his
bathe they gave him a clean cotton sleeping suit and a bed
with Christian sheets. They brought broth to him, when
he was in bed, but he was asleep before it came: he slept
for fifteen hours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the afternoon of the next day, when he woke, he
found his clothes washed and mended. Uncle Philip and
the girl brought him a coat, a sombrero and a pair of new
shoes, which they pressed him to accept with a grace and
sweetness of welcome which moved him almost to tears.
“Guests come from God,” they said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hosts, too,” he thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I ever can,” he said, “I will bring these things
back: be sure. I can never, never thank you enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had dressed, he came to the girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What has happened?” he asked. “I’ve been lost for
a week. What has happened in the country?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is war,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In Santa Barbara city?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We do not hear of the city, save once in the week,
when the ore-train returns with the empty trucks. No;
but one from the west came here yesterday to call us to
war. There are thousands, he said, marching to Santa
Barbara.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For our religion, so he said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that Don Manuel?” Hi asked. “Is it Don
Manuel’s army that is marching?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not know. It will be some army.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where it is?” Hi asked. “Do you happen to know
where it is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was near here, within a short ride, yesterday,” she
said, “going to Anselmo, the place you asked about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is it,” he said. “If the army comes from the
west and is marching east it must be Don Manuel’s army,
going to save Carlotta. Is it a White army?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank heaven,” he said, “Ezekiel Rust got through.
You do not know, do you, whether the Reds have harmed
one Señorita de Leyva?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose all the people here have gone to the army?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” the girl said. “One or two have gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t you Whites here? Are you Reds?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have the work to do: it is the people in cities who
have these quarrels.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But in this quarrel,” he said, “surely everyone must
join.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The work has to be done. If these city people worked,
they would not have the time to quarrel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, wouldn’t they,” he said, “that’s all you know of
men. But, look here, how can I get to Anselmo?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are not going to fight?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been trusted with a message to Don Manuel. If
he is to be at Anselmo, I must try to get there to meet
him. You’re sure it is Anselmo?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The men from here went there last night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how can I get there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The ore-train to Piedras Blancas, going to-night,” she
said, “would take you to within ten miles of it, so
Hernando says.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could I go in that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uncle Philip will speak to the engine driver.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, thank you. At what time would the train reach
the place within ten miles of Anselmo?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who knows, with a thing so dangerous as a train?
Perhaps at midnight: perhaps at dawn. Sometimes it
is two days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good heaven. Is the engine-driver likely to refuse to
take me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hernando says that soldiers were searching the line
yesterday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What soldiers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Red soldiers: State soldiers from Meruel. They were
looking to see if the Whites were coming by train.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has there been any battle yet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have heard of none. They expected none till they
are close to the city.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank heaven,” Hi said, “perhaps I shall be with
them in time, after all. And, oh, will you ask your Uncle
Philip to beseech the engine-driver to take me? Say it’s
very, very important: for a woman’s life may depend on it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He ask all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suppose he refuse,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He not refuse, unless he got soldiers with him. But
Hernando says they may explode the line to stop the
soldiers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, at eight that evening, when the engine-driver
took Hi as a passenger, the line had not been exploded
and no news had come of a battle. The engine-driver was
a Scot from Lanark, who had seen a detachment of the
Western army away in the west two days before. “They
came to the siding at Zamorra,” he said, “to lift the oats
stored there for the teams. Their captain was with them,
a very big man, fierce-looking, with fine hands. What’s
this, they call him? Manuel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Manuel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The damned marauding son of a gun will get his neck
in a noose before he’s much older.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will he?” Hi asked. “He has the right on his side.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be damned to the right on his side. He’s setting up
a civil war here, because he don’t like the laws of the
opposition. Yon’s a damned precedent. However, he’ll
be soon hanged and his moss-troopers the same. Now get
in, lad, to your nest: she’s starting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi leaned out to shake hands with the girl, Uncle Philip
and Hernando, who had come to see him off. He thanked
them again and again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you come these way again,” the girl said, “you
look us up, what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That indeed I will do,” Hi said. “And I wish I could
thank you or repay you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The train’s jerk at starting flung him from his farewells
into his nest among the ore, where he passed this the last
night of his journey to fetch Don Manuel.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch18'>XVIII</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>S</span>hortly</span> before dawn the next morning the train
stopped at the quarry-siding of Piedras Blancas,
where the cooks of a squadron of Meruel Reds were
preparing broth and maté with water from the railway
tanks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There you are, lad,” the driver said, as he bade Hi
good-bye. “Here’s a wheen good law-and-order men to
give yon marauding Manuel his paiks. More power to
ye, sons,” he cried, raising his voice. “And hang yon
idolatrous Deeck Turpin on a sour apple-tree.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On leaving the train, Hi slipped through the crowd of
quarry men and soldiers, out of the siding to the road.
Men and horses were coming from their billets in the village.
The cliff of the quarry loomed out white: the stone dust
made the village like moonlight or a flour mill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turning rapidly away downhill, he came to a grassy
bank, where he breakfasted on food which the girl had
provided. As he ate, all that expanse of the plain came
into light and colour from the morning: he could see.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There, far away, was Santa Barbara, glittering under
a smudge of mist, which hung over the violet of the sea.
There, less than half way to the city, was the hill to which
he had been struggling all these days. That heave of hill,
topped by the church tower, one pinnacle of which was
a statue of Our Lady, was the hill of Anselmo, distant.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
He could not say how far distant it was, in that deceptive
light: “Ten miles,” they had said, but it might well be
fifteen. “Oh, for a telescope or a pair of glasses,” he
said, “then I could see if the White army is there. That is
where it must be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he turned towards Anselmo, he heard the sergeants of
the Meruel Reds calling the roll at the siding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those fellows are here for no good,” he thought. “I’ll
get along to Don Manuel before I am stopped.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun strode up out of the sea to give to the country
a beauty, unspeakable to one who had been for a week in
the gloom of the forest. To the joy of the light was added
a beauty of overwhelming blossom, so great that the soul
of the earth seemed to be exulting in the sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall reach Don Manuel after all,” he said. “I shall
be actually with him when we save Carlotta from the
prison. And, oh, thank God, after all, I have helped a
little, for Rust has gotten through.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After an hour and a half of walking, he was so far down
into the plain that Anselmo was almost merged in the tree
clumps at its base. It seemed to be less than two miles to
the tower. The track led through clumps of ilex into
groves of timber, among which a brook ran. As he passed
into the cover of the ilex, he looked back at the land from
which he had come, at the foothills like an advanced guard
and the mountains like an army of kings. On the track
by which he had come, he saw horsemen coming in twos
at a rather quick trot. “There are those soldiers who
were at the station,” he thought. “They are coming this
way, too. Can they be coming to join Don Manuel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Why should they not be? They were State troops, but
in civil wars, troops sometimes pass from the State to its
rebels. “They can’t be coming to attack him, anyway,”
he thought, “for there aren’t a hundred of them, and Don
Manuel has thousands, so they said. If Don Manuel be
in the village there, they’ll meet their match.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It came into his mind that if these men were coming to
attack, or if Don Manuel, being at Anselmo, came out to
attack them, his own position, between the two forces,
would be perilous. He therefore hurried through the
cover, and pastures beyond to a copse of Turkey-oak which
hid all sight of Anselmo hill. As he went, he listened for
some sound of Don Manuel’s army, the noise of many hoofs,
the call of bugles, the shouting of orders, or even a shot from
a picket. As he heard no such sounds he concluded that the
army was not there. “Perhaps it has gone on to Santa
Barbara,” he thought. “I may be just too late for it,
through sleeping too long yesterday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he thought, “It is more likely that they are all in
Anselmo town on the other side of the hill. And more
likely still that they haven’t yet reached Anselmo. They’ve
been coming a long way on very bad going; they’re bound
to have crocked a lot of horses. That’s it, no doubt. I’ve
got here before them. In which case, good Lord, those
Reds behind me will probably take me prisoner. I’d better
hide in this copse till they’ve gone on or shown their hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had not gone far into the copse of Turkey-oak, when
he suddenly found that the further half of the copse was
full of soldiers. His first thought was, “Here are the
Whites,” but a clearer view showed him that they wore
dusty reddish Meruel uniforms such as he had seen at the
station at dawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Meruel Reds,” he thought, “I wish I knew which side
they are on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To hesitate would have looked suspicious: he walked
boldly on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall jolly soon know which side they’re on,” he
thought. “They’re Reds. I’ll bet my burial money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those whom he saw were single mounted troopers, each
holding three unmounted horses. All were craned forward
on their horses’ necks intently watching something that
was being done outside the copse towards Anselmo. Beyond
these horseholders, some dismounted troopers with carbines
at the ready were at the edge of the copse, also intently
watching. Two officers who were there staring at Anselmo
through glasses, caught sight of Hi. One of them challenged
in Spanish and at once moved up to him, to ask who he
was, and what he wanted there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am English,” Hi answered, “I am going to Anselmo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What for?” the officer asked, in good English.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To see George Elena?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A horse-breeder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To borrow a horse to get back to Santa Barbara.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where do you come from?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been lost in the forest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I lost my way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you lost your way, did you,” the officer said,
becoming somewhat harder in his manner. “Why do you
wear that coat and hat? you are not a native here. Why
are you disguised?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My own clothes were ruined in the forest as you can see,”
Hi said. “Some kind people at San Marco, where I came
out of the forest, gave me these to make up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other officer moved over to them, to ask what his
brother had asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So, a sacred pekin,” he said. They talked in Spanish
for a moment, with looks at Hi which were not favourable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Zubiga,” the elder officer called, to a couple of orderlies,
who jumped forward at the order, “Take this man in
charge.” Then turning to Hi, he said, “You will stand
aside a little. We will see later.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mayn’t I go on to Anselmo?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No: sacred pekin, you mayn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They left him with the orderlies, while they returned
towards the edge of the copse to watch what their scouts
were doing. “They are sending out spies,” Hi thought.
“I’ve come just too late. Don Manuel is up the hill in
Anselmo, and if I’d only been here an hour sooner, I’d have
joined him before these devils arrived. Now I’m diddled
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After some minutes of suspense, the squadron from
Piedras Blancas entered the copse. The officer in charge
of it took the salute of the two officers who had stopped
Hi; he spoke to them both, went to the edge of the copse,
to watch what was being done, talked for a few minutes
there, and then came to Hi. He was an elderly man, with
a frank, fearless face, and the pug-nosed look of a lightweight
boxer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like all the officers of the army he spoke English.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When were you last in Anselmo?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have never been there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never; yet you know people there. Do you speak
Spanish?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No: unfortunately. I’ve only been about a fortnight
in this country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where were you last night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the ore-train coming from San Marco to Piedras
Blancas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where were you yesterday?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At San Marco.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you see or hear anything of a rebel army at San
Marco?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How old are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eighteen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you doing in this country? How did you
come here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi told him as much as he thought sufficient: it did not
ring quite true. The officer seemed puzzled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were you in Piedras Blancas this morning?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You saw these troops?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you see troops yesterday?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet you saw these this morning, you say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And at once decided that you would bring the news
of what you had seen to Anselmo?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all,” Hi said. “I’m not a spy. I happen to
know that the Elenas in Anselmo have horses, and as they
know friends of mine in Santa Barbara I hoped to borrow
a horse to ride home on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The officer frowned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s something not quite right, somewhere,” he
said, “I don’t see what brings you here. What friends
have you in Santa Barbara?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Winter of Quezon. Mr. Weycock of the Sugar
Company knows me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“English people?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” the officer said. “Stand easy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood easy for a few seconds, considering, then he
returned to Hi.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You say you were taken to Ribote and then lost your
way in the forest? What were you doing when you were
taken to Ribote?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Going to Anselmo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To see the Elenas’ horses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You say this was ten days ago?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should you see the Elenas’ horses?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father is a horse-breeder in England.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’re lying,” the officer said, “it may be a very
serious matter for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not lying,” Hi said: he hoped that he wasn’t.
A couple of scouts rode in to the copse to report: the officer
left Hi to examine them: he went with them to the copse-edge
while they explained something. Hi could see them
gesticulating, while the officer tried to get at the truth.
After a minute’s thought, he called the other officers, explained
the situation to them, and gave the order to mount.
Seeing Hi, he called to the orderly in Spanish to bring the
boy with him. “Mount him on a spare horse,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir,” Hi called out. “Will you not let me go on to
Anselmo?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sacred pekin,” the pekin officer answered. “And
make less noise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the squadron had mounted, with Hi in their midst
on a spare horse, the files moved away out of the copse into
the open. They moved across a scrubby pasture in a
direction parallel with Anselmo hill. Flankers rode out
to their left, and all eyes were turned to the left, not to
Anselmo, but to a roll of rising ground beyond it. “That
is where Don Manuel is, then,” Hi thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they drew clear of the trees, Hi had for a moment a
good view of Anselmo. It was like one of the little hill
cities which he had seen in Italy, except that it was smaller
than any, and stood upon a smaller hill. A clump of trees
grew on the hillside so as to hide most of the wall with
gray-green leaves. From the edge of the wood the white
church tower rose, topped by its statue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When this was about a mile behind them, the troops
came over the roll of ground into sight of the plain stretching
on into the west. There, rather more than a mile away, was
a big white estancia with a haras or horse-breeding stable
beside it, below three conspicuous windmill pumps. About
half a mile beyond this, moving slowly towards Santa
Barbara, was a large body of mounted men, with flankers
thrown out on both sides, and many spare horses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There they are,” everybody said at once. “There it is,”
Hi said to himself. “That is Don Manuel’s army, or a
part of it; and that big breeding stable is the Elenas’ place,
where I ought to have been ten days ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now,” he thought, with a quickening pulse,
“I shall probable see a battle; and these hundred odd
Reds will get licked as they deserve.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, the officer of his party had no intention of
engaging. He hung to the rear of the moving army for
rather more than a mile: then, at a crossing of tracks, he
turned away directly to Santa Barbara and gave the order
to trot. It was perhaps ten in the morning when they left
the cross roads: it must have been mid-day when they
halted at the Inn of the Little Foxes, where a trooper,
bearing a red pennon, stood at the door: the inn being
a headquarters of some kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The commander went into the inn to report and to ask for
orders. He was gone for a quarter of an hour, during which
a shot was fired a mile or two to the west. It was followed
by several shots, of different qualities, answering each other.
After this, though the firing often almost ceased, and
sometimes sounded from further away, it never quite ceased
and on the whole drew nearer. It was all independent
firing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It reminded Hi of the sounds of pheasant shooting at
home in the unpreserved downland coverts where birds
are scarce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the commander came out, another officer was with
him. This one seemed to be a general, preparing to ride.
He was flicking his spotless boots with a silk handkerchief,
and walking with an arch of the legs caused partly by tight
breeches, partly by affectation. “Where is this English
fellow?” he called.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, sir,” the commander said. “Bring him up,
you.” Hi was led forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe, boy, that you are a spy,” the general said.
“I’ve a good mind to shoot you. Most soldiers in my place
would shoot you. As it happens, my orders are not to
shoot aliens, but to send them in for trial; which I shall do.
You will go in to Santa Barbara till your case can be sifted
a little. Any misfortune which happens to you you will
have brought upon yourself.” He called in Spanish to
some troopers to take Hi to the waggons which were about
to start under escort to the city. He also gave them a few
written words about Hi’s case for the escort commander.
As Hi now knew what answer any officer would give to him,
if he replied, he held his peace. The troopers gave him
into the charge of the escort of the waggon, who told him,
in English, to get into a waggon. When Hi asked which
waggon, for there were half a dozen tilted army waggons all
of one pattern, the man told him that he did not care which
waggon, but that if he did not get into one straightaway
he would break his face. “Get into that one there,” he
cried, “and don’t show your face outside the tilt or you’ll
get a butt in the lip.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t come in here,” an Englishman, inside the
waggon said, “this one is full up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you waiting for?” the escort called. “Get
in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is full up,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Full up,” the man replied. “Who says it’s full up?
You sacred suspects should all be shot if I’d my way. I’ll
see if you’re full up. Get in. Make way for him, you.
Now get in.” With a cudgel which he carried he poked the
suspects till they made room; then Hi was thrust in among
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The waggon was full. It contained an Englishman with
a Spanish wife and three little children; an elderly
American in the pineapple trade; an imbecile of doubtful
nationality who dribbled at the mouth and gurgled in the
throat; a strong young native woman in hysterics; an old
woman who was drunk; her grandson, who had eaten
something which had disagreed with him; three native
men, one of them very old and infirm, the second shot in the
body, unconscious and plainly near death, the third in a
dreadful condition with fever. On the top of the discomforts
of Hi’s entrance, the waggons started.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why couldn’t you have gone to one of the other
waggons?” the Englishman said. “You could have seen
that this was full, one would have thought.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had to do what I was told,” Hi said. “It’s not my
fault.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At least you can give a lady room,” the man replied,
“you can see that there’s a lady here in an interesting
condition.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry,” Hi said, moving as far as he could, “I
did not see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any man of decent feeling would stand up,” the man
said. “But perhaps you don’t come from the fobug St.
German.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, perhaps you don’t understand Latin; it’s where
manners is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I wish we were there,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That touched you where you live,” the American said.
“This kid ain’t to blame for coming here. Though I’ll
roast this gol-derned Government for putting him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, ay, ay, de mi,” the young woman called, as she
rose to a sitting posture and clawed with both hands in the
faces beside her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come off with all that, Angelita,” the American said.
“You, mister, catch a holt of that hand and I’ll catch a
holt of this; then she won’t do us an injury.” Hi caught
one of the arms of the young woman as he was bid, but she
was strong in the arm and writhing all ways at once.
“Gee,” the American said, “this young woman will ask
her husband how about it when he comes home from his
Lodge; she won’t wait till day dawns.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Hi hove down the arm of the young woman, the
imbecile began to coo at him, with symptoms of affection.
Presently the Englishman, who was a tall, thin, hatchet-faced
man, with little moustaches waxed at the ends, said:
“That captain-man ought to be shot for sending a lady in
such a state in a waggon like this. I have been here five
years and this is my reward. My wife now is going to be
sick. It is the fresh air beating upon her, in her present
state.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old woman, who was drunk, here shoved her grandson
to the tail-board of the waggon; the fresh air seemed
to have beaten upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is a nice way to send a lady to the city,” the
Englishman said. “That boy ought to be ashamed of
himself. As for that captain-man, I shall complain to the
Government. It is a marvel that she doesn’t miscarry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’ll run a darned good chance of that,” the American
said. “The Whites will be here this afternoon. There’ll
be fighting in the streets to-night. So if you know a good
snug cellar in a back street, get to it, pronto.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here the three children of the Englishman began to
cry; their mother, who was a big woman with a white
fat face and jowl, boxed their ears for crying. The drunken
woman, having soothed her grandson a little, drank from a
bottle; then, rising from the floor to her feet, tried to
dance, lifting her skirts to her knee. All this time the
waggon was swaying forward at a good pace on a rough
road; the children were weeping, the Englishman was
growling, the young woman was writhing and hysterical,
the old man was motionless, the dying man gasping for air,
and the man with the fever was shivering. Hi and the
American were trying to keep the girl in one place. The
imbecile, who had decided that he liked Hi, kept pressing
close to him and patting the back of his neck. Hi, who
had no free hand, kept warding him off with his elbow;
but the creature, perhaps mistaking this for a return of
affection, pressed back, cooing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl suddenly shook herself free and shrieked at the
top of her voice. She did not know what she was doing;
all her young muscular body was out of control. Hi
remembered tales in the Bible of people who “had a devil”;
this young woman had a devil, or the devil had her. “Look
out, kid,” the American called, “she’s into the hay-lot, your
side.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come back,” Hi called. “Be quiet, señorita; it’s all
right. We’re all friends here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Friends,” the American said, “I guess we are. It’s
these darned Santa Barbarians who are the enemies in this
land. They’ll knock my apple season galley west. Lie
still, Angelita, lie still.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all these hidalgos,” the Englishman said. “They
cause the trouble in this land. What this land wants is to
be opened up to free competition and progress. It wants
white men. These priests and these hidalgos are fallacies;
they ought to have been exploded long ago. If the English
Government doesn’t step in, it ought to be made to. My
wife is a Pinamente; one of the oldest families, if we had
our rights; and here these soldiers, these fine jacks-in-office,
send her in a waggon like this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel for her,” the American said, “being of a darned
old family myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this moment, above the noise of the waggons, as they
bumped and lurched along, there came the whine and beat
of barbaric music. The waggons drew to the side of the
track, while the music grew louder and went by. Some
hundreds of horses in twos went by, with a scuffling up of
dust and the stink of sweat, horses and hot leather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pitubas moving out,” the American said. “I told you
the Whites are coming. They’ll fight this day and the
Whites’ll whip.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know?” the Englishman asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I’ve been in the fighting business; had three
years of it, and I know fighters when I see them. Man for
man, the Whites will put rings round these yellow devils.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You lie,” the old drunken woman said suddenly, in
very good English, blinking like an owl. “Damn your
soul, you lie.” She blinked, but said no more; as it
happened, it was all the English she knew. The waggon
halted by the side of the track as other music drew nearer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Their darned national anthem,” the American said,
beginning to sing to the tune.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perro de Rojo,” the old woman screamed. “Abajo,
perro de Rojo,” she leaped up to a kneeling posture and
spat in the American’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, now, momma,” he said, “That don’t go. You
didn’t ought to spit at people, even when you’ve bit ’em
and hate the taste.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She snarled at him like a wild beast; then, seeing foot
soldiers marching by in the dust stirred up by the Pitubas’
horses, she wrestled her way to the tail-board of the
waggon, from which she cursed them for being Red.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come back into the waggon, mother,” the American
said. “Gee, kid, catch a holt of mommer. These Reds
will shoot her if she don’t let up.” An officer who was
passing struck her with the flat of his sword in the face:
“Keep in,” he said. “And you, driver, get on with you
into the city.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The waggon moved on slowly after that. Troops were
passing, horse, foot and a few guns, with waggons and
gear. They were in the suburbs by this time, among
houses, in a stream of people who were setting into the
city, carrying whatever they could from their homes in the
threat of war. At the gate, there was delay and confusion;
the waggon was jammed in the crowd, waiting its turn to
pass. When they came through the gate, a big mulatto,
with a bright green ostrich plume in his hat, looked under
the tilt at them, and said, “Suspecteds. Take all
Suspecteds to the Church of the Sanctity of Lopez, once
called by the slaves of superstition Trinity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had not far to go to this church. They passed a
public square used as a camp for refugees, then they entered
what seemed like a city of the dead, where none stirred out
from the shuttered houses. As the guards herded them
into the church once called the Trinity, Hi heard the distant
fire of rifles, popping more constantly from the region
through which he had passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Skirmishers’ independent fire,” the American said.
“If it comes nearer, it’s a sign the Whites have whipped;
if it dies down, it’s a sign the Whites are whipped. Say,”
he continued, to one of the Red officers at the church-door,
“we here are American and English citizens. Don’t you
think to gaol us, but send us to our Consuls.” He repeated
this pointedly in Spanish. “We’re not going to stand for
being gaoled,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is no gaol,” the officer explained, “but a shelter
till affairs are resolved. Whom do you wish to see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The American Consul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The English Consul,” the Englishman said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to go to my hotel, the Santiago,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is closed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then to the English Club.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That, too, is closed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then the English Consul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The officer made notes in pencil upon a piece of paper.
“Word will be sent at once to your Consuls,” he said.
“Now enter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be darned if I enter,” the American said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half a dozen troopers flung him violently into the church;
Hi and the Englishman were flung in on top of him, and the
doors were closed and locked upon them. Two English-speaking
guards in the pulpit called out to them to be quiet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we insist on seeing our Consuls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Consuls sent for,” the men said. “Hold your rows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll bet the Consuls aren’t sent for,” the American said.
“I know my darned Barbarians by this time.”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch19'>XIX</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>I</span>t</span> was about half-past one in the afternoon when the
church doors closed: the sound of the rifle fire continued,
in an irregular popping as though the people
some miles away were letting off fire crackers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s not fighting,” the American said, “that’s still
only skirmishing. These darned people can neither make
war nor keep peace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The church was of a Renaissance model, with rounded
windows high up in the walls, and a ceiling painted with
simpering ladies in clothes like rolls of blue smoke. All
the sacred symbols had been wrenched or cut away from the
decorations. A big coloured print of Don Lopez stood in a
gilt frame over the altar. It represented him in evening
dress with a red sash across his shirt. It had a dreadful
likeness to a pig whose throat had been cut. Under him
in gilt letters was the legend:</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>Liberty from Superstition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were about a hundred men, women and children
of the suspected imprisoned there: most of them were
stunned, some were terrified: one or two, like the young
girl, hysterical. What shocked Hi was the atmosphere of
suspicion: all there were afraid that the next person was
a spy. They looked at each other, but hardly spoke,
hardly even whispered. They watched the shot man die
and the fevered man shake, without interest and without
help: I was I, he was he; self was become terribly important,
and sympathy a dangerous thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve been through the mill, these people,” the
American said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know the Whites will be here this afternoon?”
Hi asked him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cut it right out, son,” the American said. “I’ve been
through one of these picnics once before here. This place
is plum full of spies. You’d best not talk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But do you know if the Reds have killed anyone here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Killed? I dunno. I guess they won’t kill till they
see which way the weasel pops. If they whip, they’ll rip
around. But you stay quiet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The advice was good, for even as they talked a man
edged a little nearer to them, with the look of the eavesdropper.
When he found that the two fell silent, he
sidled up to Hi, indicated the portrait over the altar, and
said: “Look at that. I call that a dam’ outrage: don’t
you?” Something in the look of the man reminded Hi
of the brothel-touts who had beset him at the landing
stairs before ’Zeke drove them away: it flashed into his
mind that this man might be a spy: so he answered,
“No, I call it ‘Liberty from Superstition.’ ” The man was
puzzled by the answer, but seemed to consider Hi’s youth,
and then moved away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon after this, an armed guard appeared at the door,
under an officer, who explained that the married couples
as well as all women and children there in prison were to
be moved “in the interests of morality” to another church,
where they would be alone. As some of them expected
to be murdered outside the doors, this caused a piteous
scene, of screaming and begging for mercy, but by persuasion
and force the removal was made. Among those
removed, to Hi’s great relief, was the Englishman with the
Spanish wife, the pride of the Pinamentes, and their three
children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the doors were open, some sweepers from the
barracks brought in a cask of water and a basket of army
bread for the use of the prisoners for which those with any
appetites left were glad and thankful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The American tried to find out from these sweepers what
was happening outside. They would not answer him
except by shaking their heads: when the guards noticed
the questioning they ordered the prisoners not to speak to
the sweepers on pain of being shot. “These Red Runts
are plum scared,” the American said. “They wouldn’t
bring us food unless they were afraid of being whipped.
They’re keeping both sides the fence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi was cheered by this, as by nothing else. After three
minutes in the church, he had felt that he knew and
loathed every detail of it. He tried walking up and down
the aisles; but the sense, that he was a prisoner, took all
the interest out of walking. He tried lying down to sleep,
but the sense that he was a prisoner, the knowledge that
he had failed, and the excitement of the coming battle,
kept him awake. He tried to pray that the Whites would
rout the Reds; but the excitement and anxiety were too
great, he could not put the prayer into words. Time
seemed to stand still, all reality seemed to have ceased;
he lay in a horrible nothing, anxious unspeakably. Everybody
there in the church was in the same state. When Hi
listened, he felt that everybody in the city was in the same
state. One of the strange things of that afternoon was
the silence in the town about them; it seemed like a town
of the dead, save for the pacing of the guards outside the
doors, and the occasional passing of patrols. At about
half-past three, the distant firing, which had hardly varied
in volume for two hours, increased and changed. Plainly
some much heavier metal had come into action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two batteries of four guns,” the American said, after
listening. “Number three gun in one of ’em is slow in
getting off. They’ve only four batteries in their whole
army: and one of them’s in pawn, for the Dictator’s new
state coach.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The firing is nearer than it was,” Hi said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s more of it,” the American said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was more of it for half an hour: then suddenly it
increased to a rolling, rattling racket much nearer at hand.
This went on with the utmost fury for twenty minutes,
during which all the windows in Santa Barbara rattled
and trembled. Hi could hear shouting in the noise of the
firing: then the shouting ceased and the firing dwindled
away to a popping till it almost ceased, too. He looked to
the American for an explanation. “That was an attack,”
he said. “But I guess they’ve grown tired of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed as though that were the case, that they were
tired of it. The light began to move from the floor up the
wall as the sun went down the sky. The day of battle
and suspense seemed coming to an end. Then suddenly,
within a quarter of a mile of them, seemingly somewhere on
the sea-front of the city, there came a clattering of horse-hoofs
and shouting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this, there was silence, while everybody waited in
suspense for a quarter of an hour, when a sudden shattering
volley from close at hand sent the hearts into the throats.
Ricochetting bullets struck the near-by roofs, there were
falls of plaster and of tiles and the cries of women, while
the space down by the sea-front began to roar with firing:
hot and hot, so near at hand that presently the stink of the
powder drifted into the church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The firing went on for nearly an hour, dwindling as the
light dwindled, till by the time the church was dark, save
for the moonlight, it ceased altogether.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Whites must have entered the town and won,”
Hi said to the American. “That firing was in the town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was in the town all right,” the American said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi rose from his seat and began to pace up and down in
his excitement. The thought of Carlotta being set free
was more than he could bear. The guards lit a couple of
candles in a side chapel, peered to see who was walking,
and called to Hi to keep still. The town outside was
deathly still for some time after the firing had ceased: then
all the streets began to ring with the trotting of horses,
coming into the city from the direction of the Medinas
Gate. They came in at a fast trot on at least three roads,
so that the clatter and clink filled the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here the conquering heroes come,” the Americans said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Whites?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the side that’s won anyway, or they wouldn’t
come in in order.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the White army is cavalry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our darned Consuls might get a wiggle on without
slopping over into speed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t suppose they know we’re here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s their job to know we’re not here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cavalry, whoever they were, went to their stations
or bivouacs and ceased to clatter. The town lapsed again
into silence. Presently, in the quiet, within a hundred
yards of the church, a sentry challenged someone, waited
for two seconds, and fired. Someone cried out and fell,
while the sentry jerked out the shell, which tinkled on the
stones, reloaded and snapped-to the breech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The sentry’s night to howl,” the American said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon after this, when the town was silent save for the
pacing of the feet of sentries here and there, and the
occasional slow passing of horse patrols, some volley-firings,
of three or four rifles together, began in the direction of the
cathedral. These volleys were repeated at short intervals
for twenty minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is that sort of firing?” Hi asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It can only be executions,” the American said.
“They’re shooting people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Deserters?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; or prisoners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Prisoners of war? Surely not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any gol-darned prisoner’s good enough to shoot in
this gol-darned Republic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then it means that the Whites have won?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it would seem so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope to God they have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, kid, don’t hope it publicly till you know it’s
a fact.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you think that the Whites have won?” Hi asked
in a whisper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll know soon enough.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>At about ten o’clock, when most of those in the church
had begun to think that nothing more would happen that
night, a strong guard marched into the little plaza outside
the church and halted there. Hi suddenly saw a great
increase in the light outside, for the newcomers had lit
flares there. The doors of the church were opened and a
strong squad of armed guards entered. A prim-lipped
man, with the look of a “spoiled priest,” who seemed to be
in charge of the guard, gave orders that the altar should be
brought from a side chapel, and placed as a table near the
door. When the altar had been placed, and its candles
lighted, he seated himself upon a chair there, asked for the
register of the prisoners, and began to read it through.
From time to time he looked into the body of the church,
where he could see hardly anything, but a few white faces,
the twinkle of the two candles in the nave and the glistening
of some of the gilding. Hi heard two or three of the
prisoners near him praying beneath their breath with the
intensity of terror. He watched the prim-lipped man just
as his rabbit had watched the snake. The man seemed to
be waiting for some one who did not come. Beyond him,
Hi could see the dip at the church steps, a market-flare
burning, and moving shadows. The prim-lipped man
marked his register with a pencil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, sport,” the American said, stepping up to him,
“we ain’t your nationals. We demand our release or our
Consuls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the other English-speaking people there, eight in all,
joined in, in this appeal. The prim-lipped man listened
to them all with courtesy, then he said, in English, with an
Irish accent:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the very unsettled state of the city, you are safer
here than you could be elsewhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That may be or may not be, but I guess our countries
are pretty well able to protect us. We are unlawfully
detained here. We’ve been here pretty well all day.
We’ve protested, and demanded our Consuls. What are
you going to do about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prim-lipped man listened again. “You will understand,”
he said at last, “that I am not responsible in any
way for anything that may have happened to you in these
disorders, nor for your being here now. I am sincerely
sorry that you should have been inconvenienced. I must
ask you to blame the time, and those guilty for the time,
not the Republic. In a few minutes, the commandant of
this ward will be here, when I promise you that your cases
shall be heard. In the meantime, let me see each one of
you, who claim not to be of our nation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eight came forward to the table in a body, and
explained in turn who and what they were. The prim-lipped
man accepted each claim. “You will understand,”
he said, “that in these disorders we have to use every care
to protect those domiciled among us. As the disorders are
now over, I do not think that you will be inconvenienced
beyond to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you tell us, sir,” Hi asked, “what exactly has
happened here?” The American’s hand pressed Hi’s
arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Happened?” the prim-lipped man said. “Order has
been restored, or is fast being restored. The Republic
has been saved.” He looked at the papers, to see what
Hi was charged with, then dismissed the eight to one side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is this man a White?” Hi wondered. “Are those
guards White? They wear no white upon their uniforms,
but neither do they wear any red. Supposing Don Manuel
were suddenly to appear with the commandant: oh,
that would be joy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Almost immediately after this a carriage drove to the
steps of the church and halted there. Hi heard the guards
called to attention and ordered to salute. The prim-lipped
man turned to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the commandant,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some footsteps sounded upon the church steps, one of
the feet clinked with spurs. Hi craned forward to see who
entered, feeling sure that Don Manuel would be among
the party: something within him told him that he was
there, coming victorious to set his servants free. “Oh,
Don Manuel,” he thought, “if it is only you, I don’t
think I’ll care what happens to me for ever after.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three people entered together into the light of the altar
candles. The truth came upon Hi with a stunning of
heart and head: these people were Reds, the Reds had
won.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three who entered were:—a big, flashy, free moving,
swaggering type of cavalryman, wearing a scarlet sash
across his uniform: the big negro with the green feather,
whom Hi had seen taking the Piranhas’ horses; and a
woman, who also wore a scarlet sash across her shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gee, kid, there’s the were-wolf,” the American
whispered to Hi. “Now there’ll be blood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anna, the were-wolf: an anti-cleric: been fighting
the church all her life. She’s a Red from Medinas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then the Reds have won?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You bet your sweet life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman and the soldier seated themselves at the table
with the prim-lipped man; the cavalryman asked some
questions, the prim-lipped man seemed to be explaining
about the foreigners. The woman looked through the
registers: Green Feather, with a drawn sword, stood at
the door. As the woman, Anna, sat nearest to Hi, in a
good light, he had occasion to notice her very particularly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was perhaps seventy years old. She had a face without
any mark whatsoever of kindness, or mirth, or hope, or
charity. Her eyes were grey, hard and stony: her mouth
was a slit, drooped at the ends: her ears were enormous:
her hair, which was of a dirty grey, fell untidily about her
brow; she kept thrusting it back with a fat red hand,
the thick fingers of which were black at the end. She had
ploughed and sowed against her enemies for fifty-three
years of hatred: now she had her hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prim-lipped man rose from his chair and called:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will those English and American subjects come
forward?” When they had come forward, he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The commandant of the ward wishes me to say that
during these disturbances, in the state of martial law in
which we live, foreigners not vouched for by the municipalities
in which they sojourn are required to repair on
board the ships of the nations to which they belong, or to
such other ships as will receive them. Which of you have
carnets signed by your municipal authorities?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>None had any such papers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None?” the prim-lipped man said. “Very well, then,
you will repair on board the ships of your respective nations.
A guard will take you from here to the Mole, where boats
are now engaged in taking those qualified to go. I will
give you here this paper to sign, opposite to your
names.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When all had signed their names, the commandant
called an officer, to whom he gave charge to embark the
eight at the Mole. The officer called them out to the plaza
below the church steps, where troops were halted. Some
of the soldiers stood in groups of four facing a blank wall
where a flare was burning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Firing parties,” someone said. “Some poor devils in
the church are for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hi, looking back, saw the white columns of the portico,
with the yellowness of candlelight inside the door, and the
blackness of Pluma Verde standing like a death. A squad
of troops formed about the eight: the officer gave the order
to march. One of the eight began to hum a Dead March.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are well out of that,” someone said. “They’ll
clear most of that bunch up against the wall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These darned foreigners: why can’t they agree?
They’re like a lot of children.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Children? They’re like a lot of savages.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we come out at the thin end of the horn, whatever
they are. We’ll not get ashore again till Lord knows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely,” Hi said, “they’ll let us go ashore again, when
the troubles are over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When will the troubles be over?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose in a week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not in a year, kid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The American had been talking in a low voice to one of
the squad of soldiers: he now spoke to the company.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See there, now,” he said, jerking his head to the right,
as they came out upon the water-front, “the Whites got
into the town here. They got in at the gate there. The
man says that they fit like hell along the beach, till all the
lot of them was killed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the lot?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Don Manuel, too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yep. Not one man left alive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Lord.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There goes some more of ’em, who weren’t in the battle
at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Behind them, from the direction of the church which they
had left, there came a sudden volley of three rifles. After
a minute there came another volley, presently a third, then
many more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These darned Reds,” the American said, “it’s their
night to howl. Those were the poor devils we were with
a few minutes since; give them a prayer, sons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They gave them their prayers, as they marched on in the
moonlight along the deserted water-front. All the houses
there were dead, with blank eyes. The rhythm of their
steps echoed from the walls, the sea washed on the shingle
beside them. The shootings still went on near that church
of liberty from superstition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blast them,” one of the eight said. “Don’t they pardon
anyone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s their night to howl,” the American said:</p>

</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think I could send a message ashore, when we
get to the ship?” Hi asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To ask after friends and to get my things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’ll be darned few messages passing after this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what are we to do, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did the cat do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. What did he do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He went back, when he couldn’t stay no longer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Consuls will help us get our things,” a man said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Consuls, hell,” another answered. “We’ll not
see a stick nor stitch of anything we had. This land is
going to have the bust-up that’s been preparing for years.
It will be a year before it’s settled. Perhaps a year after
that we may be allowed in again to settle our businesses.
Thank God, I saw a little of this coming.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time they were at the Mole, where Hi had landed
with such hopes a fortnight before. The water was gleaming
over the lower steps. Some men were standing under
the Mole light: some soldiers came to attention there as
the party drew near.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Halt, there,” a voice called.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were called one by one under the light, and sorted
out to three boats then lying at the steps, from a French
barque, an English ship and an American schooner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will there be any more to-night?” an English sailor
asked. “Shall we send the boat in again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We do not know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if any more are to come off, dip your light there
and I’ll send the boat in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dip your light. Lower and hoist your light, to let me
know you want the boat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it good?” the sailor muttered, as he shepherded
his six down the steps to the boat. “You’re about as likely
to do it as my Uncle Joe is to have kittens.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Four ordinary seamen in the boat pulled them clear of the
Mole into the harbour, towards the sailing-ship anchorage.
The firing-parties were still firing in the town. Away
beyond the Farola, a house which had been fired began to
burn up brightly. “That’s just about where the Piranhas’
house is,” Hi thought. “They’ve killed the Piranhas,
too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What ship are you taking us to?” a man asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Solita</span>, Liverpool,” the mate said. “I guess the lid’s
off the <span class='it'>Tenderloin</span> to-night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re playing hell all over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give way, sons,” the mate said. “Come, put your
weights on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They pulled on over the sea in the moonlight towards the
grove of masts. All were silent now, from weariness and
bitterness; there was no sound except the gurgle and wash
of the water, the grunt of the oars in the crutches, and
sometimes a church-bell, or a volley of shots from the city.
The mate who was steering began to croon a hymn as he
watched the <span class='it'>Solita’s</span> riding-light:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;It’s good enough for me.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Singing thus at his hymn, which could be made to last
for a day in case of need, he brought his boat to the gangway
under the lean iron flank of the <span class='it'>Solita</span>. The Captain looked
down upon him from the poop rail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that you, Mister?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir: I brought six more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on up there, you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the six stood on the deck, the captain spoke to
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are on board a British ship,” he said. “The rules
are: no smoking and no matches between decks. Any of
you caught striking a light below there will sleep on the
fo’c’sle head. Write your names here. Anderson, show
them where they belong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the boat’s crew helped them down a perpendicular
iron ladder into the gloom of a ’tweendecks which smelt of
decayed malt. A spare starboard sidelight cast a green
light on one side of this space, so that Hi could see many
bodies lying on sails. On the other side of the space two
planks upon casks made a table on which some food was
spread, in bread-barges.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can get your supper if you’d like,” Anderson said,
showing the bread-barges. “Or you can turn in on the
sails, if you’d rather rest. Your lot makes it forty-one that
we got. We’ll be able to have some fine sing-songs. The
steward says we shall probably sail within three days for
New York. There’s fresh water in the bucket there and a
dipper to drink by. Any matches you’ve got, you’ve got
to give to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Anderson had gone, Hi drew away from the six
to a lonely space on the sails, where he dragged a hatch
cover over himself, so that he might think alone. He had
had his first wrestle with life; he reckoned that he had
been an utter failure. The future was dark enough, but it
was nothing to the darkness of the present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I failed,” he thought. “And I’ve probably killed
’Zeke. And ’Zeke has brought Don Manuel to death; and
the Piranhas are probably killed too, burnt out, anyway.
And I’ve probably settled Carlotta’s fate as well. They
are certain to kill her; all by not avoiding politics, as
Winter told me. They might all be alive now, if I’d not
stirred.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mate, who was walking the deck near the hatch,
partly lest the boat should be needed, but mainly to detect
any striking of a match among the refugees, sat upon
the coamings for a minute, humming his tune of the old-time
religion. “Ah, the old-time religion,” Hi thought,
with the tears running down his face. “Nothing but
religion’s any help to a man in my state. Oh, God, I have
made a mess of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Carlotta?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ah, Carlotta.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Carlotta had been killed a week before this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day after her arrest, some hours after Hi had started
on his journey, Don Lopez ordered Carlotta to pray to him
while he sat throned in public on the high altar of the
Mission Church of Santa Barbara. On her refusal, he
ordered her to be enclosed in a house of common prostitutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mistress of this house, an Englishwoman known as
Aunt Jennings, refused to admit her, saying, “That none
but a dirty dog would have thought of sending her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When this was reported to Don Lopez, he ordered that
Carlotta and Aunt Jennings should be taken by the hangman
to the new town, and that there their throats should
be cut. This deed was at once done by Don Lopez’ son,
Don José, assisted by the two half-breeds, Zarzas and Livio.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was the first of the many crimes committed by the
Red party in the year of madness, 1887-1888.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='sc'>On the fate of Don Manuel and his army, or what
happened on the day of the battle.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>When Hi saw the White army near Anselmo, it was
moving from its bivouac towards Santa Barbara, expecting
to fight that morning. It was delayed in its march by
Pituba skirmishers, so that it did not come into position
above Santa Clara until after three in the afternoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Don Manuel had expected that a part of the Federal army,
the San Jacinto Horse, and the battalion of Independents,
would declare for him, and either join him or help him.
Their officers were known to be Whites and their men were
hostile to Lopez. Unfortunately, Colonel Velarte, of the
Horse, who was a friend of Hermengildo de Bazan, the
White leader, disliked Don Manuel and refused to help him.
The Colonel of the Independents felt that the Whites would
be ruined if he did not help Don Manuel, but would not
help unless he were given the command. While affairs
were in this state, the day before the battle, Don Livio
disarmed both these battalions and put their officers under
arrest, so that the Whites were not helped by any Federal
troops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the battle began, Don Manuel had with him
between six and seven hundred horsemen, armed in
various ways, undisciplined, without artillery, and almost
without ammunition. The Federal troops opposed to him
numbered about four thousand, including the Meruel and
Pituba regiments of horse, three battalions of Eastern foot
and two batteries of horse artillery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The battle proper began when Don Manuel’s men came
on to the little ridge above Santa Clara church. At that
point they came under shell-fire from the batteries, which
had been registered upon the ground during the morning.
As Don Manuel saw that his only chance was to charge the
guns, he charged. His men got into trip wire laid before
the guns, and were shot down there by the foot soldiers
or routed by the lancers. Some fifty or sixty of the
Encinitas men followed Don Manuel to the right of the
field, broke through a squad of Meruel horse, made a dash
for the city, entered the southern gate, and summoned
the fortress to surrender.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here, through the wit of Don Livio, they were ambushed
and driven on to the water-front, where they fought till
they were lost. The last of them made a stand about the
green boat or lighter which Hi had seen on the morning of
his setting out with Rosa. When their last cartridges were
gone, they took to the water and were killed in the bay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Don Manuel, because he took to the water after the
others, when the light was worse, contrived to reach the
English barque <span class='it'>Venturer</span>, whose Captain (Gary) received
him and brought him to safety. Some five weeks after the
battle, he landed in the United States.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of his army, it is thought that about one-half escaped
alive from the battle, and that of these perhaps a third were
killed in the pursuit or in the proscriptions which followed.
The Federal loss is not known, as the returns were falsified.
It is thought that the Reds lost many men in the skirmishing,
both before and after the battle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The battlefield, which was then mainly race ground and
market gardens, is now covered by the suburb of Santa
Clara. It is a couple of miles from Medinas, on the northern
road from the city; at a little distance the ridge (now
covered with houses) which was the White position, may
still be seen.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='sc'>On the fate of Donna Emilia and her daughter Rosa.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Donna Emilia died in misery shortly after the outbreak
of the troubles (in May, 1887). Her daughter, Rosa
Piranha, though proscribed in the September massacre,
was saved from death by the devotion of her old nurse.
The house which Hi saw burning, as he walked to the Mole,
was not the Piranhas’ home; that was spared though
sacked. Rosa returned to it when the troubles were over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In May, 1888, she entered a community of enclosed
nuns, to whom she made over all her earthly possessions.
In this sisterhood she has lived ever since.</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='hang'><span class='sc'>On the fate of Hi, after he went on board the
<span class='it'>Solita</span>.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As the aliens in the ships were not allowed to land again in
Santa Barbara during the troubles, Hi, with his fellow
refugees, went in the <span class='it'>Solita</span> to New York, where he landed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As his parents felt that he had better stay there, he
remained in the United States, where he underwent the
adventures and hardships usual to youth. After some
months there, it happened, that he met Don Manuel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he felt that his life was linked to Don Manuel by ties
not easily broken, he joined the band of White refugees
sworn to destroy Don Lopez and his faction. With these
outcasts he wandered and suffered for some months, till
that campaign began which led to the killing of Lopez and
the establishment of Don Manuel as Dictator in his stead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some years after this, Hi remained in the Western
provinces, in Don Manuel’s employment, at work upon the
problem dear to him, of perfecting steamboats for river
traffic of different kinds. In 1891, when Don Manuel
began his great scheme of controlling the San Jacinto
River, some of his ideas were put in practice. For the next
seven years, he was busily employed on the San Jacinto,
in partial or complete charge of the boat service by which
the workers on the dam were supplied. The following
letter from him, written in early May, 1898, to his mother
in England, will fill in some of the blanks in this history:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the 15th we had our great day with the opening of
the dam. His Excellency, with his staff and a lot of
senators and Congressmen, came to the pier at Curucucu,
where they took our boats for the last ten miles up to the
dam. After the formal opening, there was a banquet, at
which H. E. made a very nice speech. He said he did not
think the work would ever have been done but for my boats,
which perhaps was partly true.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About a week after the opening they finished the last
stretch of the railway so that now the waters are linked
with both coasts and my seven years’ job is at an end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As I had nothing to do, I was one of the first to take
the train to the east through the forest; and I took the
opportunity to go over the scenes of my old adventures.
I got Dick Binge and Tommy to come with me. I started
by going to San Marco, where the marriage party was so
kind to me. I found Uncle Philip still living, in the same
farm. His niece had married Hernando, the man who
dispensed the cordials in the waggon. They were living at
a farm near by and doing well. I had promised them when
I parted from them to return the clothes they gave me. I
couldn’t quite do this, but I was able to get them a couple
of pedigree cows from His Excellency, which I hope will
thrive up there on the hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After seeing them, we went with a guide two days into
the forest to the temple where the cousin of the Hundred
Yards Blue nearly plugged me. The place has long since
been opened up and explored. From some of the Indians
thereabouts I learned of the end of Letcombe-Bassett, if
that were his name. It seems that a few days after I
escaped, he worked into the temple by himself and made a
certain number of finds. A big stone fell across his legs and
pinned him there. He called to his Indians to lift the stone,
but the Indians wouldn’t, because they hadn’t liked his
ways, so he stayed pinned there for three days and nights, till
he died of thirst. So Dudley Wigmore was avenged. We
had a look for Dudley Wigmore’s bones, but the jungle had
taken charge of them. I learned later that one or two of
his things and some of the treasure from the temple were
recovered and sent to his old mother at Shepton Mallet.
This was done by one of Wigmore’s French friends, years
ago, during the troubles, soon after I was there. The rest
of the things found in the temple are in the museum at
Santa Barbara.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From this point, as so much of the forest had been
cleared and a lot of the bog drained, it was easy to make
the next stage to the ranch, where the corpse looked
through the window. Here I learned what had happened;
it had long been a puzzle to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The troop of Pitubas who had burned the Ribote house
made one or two forays into the Gaspar country, to burn
the houses of other prominent Whites. Word came that
afternoon that they were coming to burn this particular
ranch. That old ruffian, Don Pablo, who would not let me
go to Anselmo, ordered the people to vacate the ranch, and
to join his body, which (he said) would then attack the
Pitubas. They hurried the women away to safety; then,
as they rode out to join Don Pablo, someone in a panic
fired a shot, and everybody began to blaze away at nothing.
These were the shots which I heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A young Englishman employed in the ranch stayed
there after the others lest a telephone call should come
through with news of Don Manuel. While he waited, he
saw the Pituba spy and shot him through the window;
being then thoroughly scared, he took horse and galloped
away. I heard him go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The telephone call came through while I was there, as
I am not likely to forget.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The people who challenged me and shot my horse, as
I left the place, were the Pitubas, who burned the ranch to
the ground that night. I found it rebuilt and thriving.
That old ruffian, Don Pablo, owns it: he is a Senator and
a grandissimo: I saw him there. He looks liker a portrait
of a beadle than ever: a beadle or a town-bull.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From this point we rode through the forest to the
place where I went astray in the rain; and thence up the
pass to the crater; and so, by degrees, to the Ribotes’
ranch. The old man and wife were still alive. The old
man was failing and the old woman had had so many
troubles that she did not care to see me, but I paid for my
horse, I am glad to say, at last, and heard their news.
The daughter had become an enclosed nun and the son,
Anton, had been killed in the anti-clerical rebellion five
years ago. I was grieved indeed not to see those two
again. The house had been divided against itself, like so
many during the troubles. From there, I rode on to the
little town where I had been jailed. It has become a very
prosperous place since I was there. They have built a new
town hall and a new jail. They have also changed its name
from Ribote to Tres de Mayo. Some don of state had
built a lovely palace on the site of the Ribote mansion,
which was burned while I was there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From here we rode on and camped in the clump
where the officer made me a prisoner. Of all the places
which I visited, this was the only one which did not seem to
have changed. In the morning, we rode on and came to the
falls down which I had been swept when I escaped from
Brother Bright Tooth and his friend. As there was very
little water in the river it did not look the same, but I
could see the place with the overhanging bank where I
came ashore. Just at the place where I took the water
there is now a railway bridge; the track by which I rode
on Bright Tooth’s horse has now the railway beside it. The
hamlet where Bright Tooth and his mother lived has
changed beyond all recognition into a thriving market
town, but I found the German. He had become very
stout and enormously prosperous. He remembered me
quite well and told me all about Bright Tooth and his
mother. The mother, he said, went into Santa Barbara
during the troubles and was ended when the troubles were
ended. Bright Tooth and a friend of his, I hope the friend
who was with him when they tried to nobble me, were
garrotted under His Excellency for murdering an old
woman at Medinas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From this point, it was only a short stage to Carpinche,
which is now a port for big forest timber. There were
ships of up to a thousand tons in the harbour there. I
watched them heaving the great red-hearts and green-hearts
in through the holes in their bows. Not that the
forests are being skinned. They are being planted as
well as being cut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We took boat here—not a sailing boat, for those have
passed away and market produce goes now to the city by
train. We went in one of the ferries which ply every hour
from Carpinche to Santa Barbara, calling at La Boca. I
landed at La Boca to try to find word of Giordano. He
had gone back to Italy, they told me, some years ago and
was living there near Florence; very rich, they said.
Pedro Ruiz was still marketing and gardening. I saw him
at last in the flesh and bought some plants from him, which
I hope I shall make grow for the sake of old times. The
padron of my boat and Chigo had both gone back to Italy:
few Italians stay here more than seven years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From there I came on to the Farola, where I had the
long wait that anxious morning. As I landed in the late
afternoon, I was the only person there, except a few
anglers fishing for snappers. I could see what used to be
the Piranhas’ house, so leaving the pier, I walked up to it.
It is now the house of enclosed nuns in which Rosa lives.
They are contemplatives, so there was no seeing Rosa:
none of us will ever see her again, I suppose. I am too
active to take to the monkish way of life myself; but I
have seen monks and nuns out here, from time to time, who
have made me see something of what they see. When you
once see the beauty of holiness, no other beauty seems
living. Rosa is happy. I went to the house just when
they were singing their service, in that chapel which used
to be the Piranhas’ chapel, where Donna Emilia and her
husband are buried. I felt very queer, to think that
Rosa was singing there and I so near her, listening: and
suddenly I knew that she knew that I was listening, and
was sending me a message of great happiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the city, I learned of some of the rest of these
people. Don Inocencio was killed in the troubles: murdered
the day after Don Manuel lost the battle, like so many
other Whites. Allan Winter is still out at Quezon:
Weycock is in the Shipping Co. I saw him at the Club:
he is a man I cannot stick. Don José is one of his clients,
they say: he would be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I asked Colonel Peñedo at the War Office if he could
find out for me about the Pituba officer who would not let
me land and afterwards jailed me. He was a Captain
Avellano, it seems; a well-known Red and as brave as
they are made. Don Livio, that mongrel scoundrel, was
responsible for sending him to Ribote to burn the Ribote
house. It seems that he had no written orders to stop the
boats at La Boca: in doing that he was probably just being
cussed. He was a gallant man in his way: he was killed
fighting for Lopez a year later, “fighting like a wild tiger
cat, one against twenty,” so Peñedo said. The Pituba
officers were usually pretty tough: so I hope he may rest
in peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of some of the other criminals and waifs, upon whose
tracks mine impinged, I could learn nothing. Anna the
were-wolf got herself shot in the troubles by wanting to be
too revolutionary: the Reds did not kill the Whites so
that Anna and her friends might rule.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t mentioned Ezekiel Rust, because I have so
often written to you about him. He and his wife Isabella
are still out at Encarnacion; he runs the haras there, in
very good style; she seems fond of him: both are well.
He always wants to come back to England, to see Tencombe
again, but I beg him not to think of it. Many there
would recognise him, and although the evidence against
him cannot now be strong, he would be certain to incriminate
himself, and it would be too pitiful if the poor
old chap should get himself hanged or (more probably)
shut up as a criminal lunatic. Where he is now, he is a
valuable man. Where <span class='it'>he</span> is now, Keeper Jackson is, I
hope, a valuable ghost. Why not let it rest at that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I asked about that picture-dealer on the water-front.
It seems that he got a lot of things from the de Leyva
collection, chiefly the bronzes. Then Don José tried to
get them out of him, and as he wouldn’t sell them, Don
José took them, with all his other belongings, and had the
man deported. I suppose this is Don J’s nearest approach
to a virtuous act. Of course, this was years ago, only a
few days after the troubles began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H. E. had me out to dine at the palace, to ask me about
another job, opening up the Burnt Lands by canals, and
would I design the boats? It seems tame, after the San
Jacinto: like falling off a log; but I want to be in everything
that H. E. is in. He thinks that the B. L. can be
planted in patches, if there are catchments. He is the
most hopeful soul I know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the way, in the palace, I found the Aztec, the
Ribote brother. He is a sort of Secretary for Clerical
Affairs, rather a big gun. I did not remind him of our
meeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, this is a long letter: I must stop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Words cannot describe the changes in the city since
the bad old ’87 days: no town can have changed more in
the time. My love to Bell and Father. I hope to be back
in June, for a couple of months: so don’t fill the house up.”</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='hang'><span class='sc'>A note added by Highworth Ridden</span>:</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“The above was written by me to my mother soon after
the completion of the dam, when I revisited Santa Barbara
for the first time since the troubles. I left the pier on that
morning of the troubles thinking to be back in ten days:
I did not return save for that time as a prisoner for more
than eleven years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What I did not and could not write to my mother, I
write now, after another eleven years. It is about Carlotta.
It is difficult to set down what she was to me.
‘Calf-love,’ I suppose most people would say. Well, there
is a generosity in calf-love that gives it a grace: not that
mine had any grace. I saw her on only one day twenty-two
years ago: I have thought of her every day since;
not as a lover of course (for years past), but as a spirit
apart, unlike anyone else that ever was. You who never
saw her cannot understand this. She was the most
exquisite thing: in life marvellous, in the unspeakable
end, heroic: and always so beautiful, so gracious. All
who knew her felt this: she had cruel enemies, the mad, the
diseased, the godless, the savage and the greedy hated her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I went to the chapel of Carlotta, which H. E. built.
Her tomb, with her recumbent figure, is there: it is very
beautiful. Her sculptured head on the stairs leading to
the Plaza is liker her. Gamarro’s painting of her is not
like. Bedwyn’s pencil sketch is like. But she was like
the light, no one could have painted her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tried to do something for her once, and though I
failed, I am prouder of that than of anything else that I
have ever done. Whatever she was, she made men know
that gleams come into this world from a world beyond,
which is better than this.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“H. F. R.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I set out from the hotel on that morning of the
troubles, I took with me a scrap of the hermosita which
she had broken for me. This being in my pocket-book,
was stolen from me at Ribote by the Englishman who got
me out of jail. The rest of the spray, being in my trunk
at the hotel, was, as I supposed, lost, during the troubles,
with all my kit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But in 1899, being at the Club in Santa Barbara, I met
the then proprietor of the hotel, who said, that he had
recently found some trunks and bags in a disused cellar:
that these had evidently been put away during the troubles
and never claimed since, and were now to be sold. I went
to see them, and among them found one of my tin trunks,
in which were some ruined clothes. With the clothes, in
some hotel blotting-paper, I found the hermosita spray
which Carlotta had given to me, and the envelope, addressed
by her to Donna Emilia, which I had picked up and kept.
So that I have what few have, one of the last gifts and one
of the last writings of a lovely soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is all that one can say of her, that she was a lovely
soul. I have met no one in the least like her. I can but
thank God for her, knowing that she came from God.</p>

in her mortal body an angel walked, who needed but a

beside so much perfection; yet felt exaltation at the
thought that such perfection could be in this world. I can

<p class='hang'><span class='sc'>Another note upon Carlotta, by Roger Weycock.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“She was a little, sprightly thing with a lot of colour.
She was very much of a lady by birth, being a de Leyva;
but for this she might have passed for bold. She seemed
to me to be very fond of her own opinion, which was not
always wise. She had been the spoiled darling all her life;
old de Leyva’s pet; the Chavez group worshipped her.
Someone had told her, in her youth, that she was like a
little fairy. She seemed to me to be always acting the fairy.
I do not of course pretend to justify her murder, which must
ever remain a blot upon an unconstitutional but, on the
whole, rather great administration. At the same time I,
who saw her, can testify that she was not the angel from
Paradise which some, who never saw her, would have us
believe. She was a pert young woman, accustomed to her
own way, who had the tragical fate to run counter to a much
stronger way than her own. The character of Carlotta de
Leyva, as worshipped (this is scarcely too strong a word)
at present at Santa Barbara, had no original in the young
woman whom I met; it is an invention of the poets (of
the sentimental-idealistic school, of whom Tomás de
Medellin is the chief exponent), backed by an able but
quite unscrupulous propagandist press, whose interest it
is to blacken Don Lopez by every means in its power.”</p>

all, was not what she had; she had blessing power, as
though she came from Heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She was one whom many loved; surely all to their
great good. No hatred or other evil could exist in a mind
full of her memory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Once, when she was a little girl, five or six years old,
I asked her what she would do when she grew up. She
said that she would build everybody a palace. ‘What,’
I said, ‘with your little hands?’ ‘No,’ she said, ‘my
lover will build it for me.’ This I have so often, often

<p class='line0'>How some might love him, many help, but none</p>
<p class='line0'>Be wisdom to my son.</p>
<p class='line0'>Wisdom that is a road</p>

<p class='line0'>Life, strangling in the slime.</p>

</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Then in the multitude of souls I saw</p>

<p class='line0'>In the green light of even.</p>
<p class='line0'>However black (I knew) the night might turn</p>
<p class='line0'>That star would burn.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>She reached her hand to me and cried: “Death calls,</p>
<p class='line0'>Time strikes, the hour falls.</p>
<p class='line0'>And like a flight of birds the souls prepare</p>
<p class='line0'>To whirl into the air,</p>
<p class='line0'>To bring to be what none may understand.</p>
<p class='line0'>I shall but light the hand .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Lo, here, the light upon my brow shall lead</p>
<p class='line0'>Thy son until he bleed;</p>
<p class='line0'>Until he fail, and falter, and despair.</p>
<p class='line0'>Even in his blackest night I shall be there</p>
<p class='line0'>My star will be his guidance: he will know</p>
<p class='line0'>What light is, from its glow.”</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
